\section{What it does}{

Builds a concordance for a keyword, using keyword-in-context (KWIC) technique.
The first parameter is a \code{docTexts} object that contains all of your texts.
The second parameter is the keyword you are interested studying. The third gives the
size of the context
that you want to use for the concordance: i.e., how many words on each side of
your keyword that you want to look at. The context is sometimes referred to as the
'search window'.
