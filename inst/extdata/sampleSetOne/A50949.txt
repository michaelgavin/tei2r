"2","The Reason of Church-government urged against PRELATY. THE PREFACE. IN the publishing of humane lawes, which for the most part aime not beyond the good of civill society, to set them barely forth to the people without reason or Preface, like a physicall prescript, or only with threatnings, as it were a lordly command, in the judgement of Plato was thought to be done neither generously nor wisely. His advice was, seeing that persuasion certainly is a more winning, and more manlike way to keepe men in obedience then feare, that to such lawes as were of principall moment; there should be used as an induction, some well tempered discourse, shewing how good, how gainfull, how happy it must needs be to live according to honesty and justice, which being uttered with those native colours and graces of speech, as true eloquence the daughter of vertue can best bestow upon her mothers praises, would so incite, and in a manner, charme the multitude into the love of that which is really good, as to imbrace it ever after, not of custome and awe, which most men do, but of choice and purpose, with true and constant delight. But this practice we may learn, from a better & more ancient authority, then any heathen writer hath to give us, and indeed being a point of so high wisdome & worth, how could it be but we should find it in that book, within whose sacred context all wisdome is infolded? Moses therefore the only Lawgiver that we can believe to have beene visibly taught of God, knowing how vaine it was to write lawes to men whose hearts were not first seasoned with the knowledge of God and of his workes, began from the book of Genesis, as a prologue to his lawer; which Josephus 
         • ight well hath noted. That the nation of the Jewes, reading therein the universall goodnesse of God to all creatures in the Creation, and his peculiar favour to them in his election of Abraham their ancestor, from

whom they could derive so many blessings upon themselves, might be moved to obey si cerely by knowing so good a reason of their obedience. If then in the administration of civill justice, and under the obscurity of Ceremoniall rites, such care was had by the wisest of the heathen, and by Moses among the Jewes, to instruct them at least in a generall reason of that government to which their subjection was required, how much more ought the members of the Church under the Gospell seek• to informe their understanding in the reason of that government which the Church claimes to have over them: especially for that the Church hath in her immediate cure those inner parts and affections of the mind where the seat of reason is; having power to examine our spirituall knowledge, and to demand from us in Gods behalfe a service intirely reasonable. But because about the manner and order of this government, whether it ought to be Presbyteriall, or Prelaticall, such endlesse question, or rather uproare is arisen in this land, as may be justly termed, what the feaver is to the Physitians, the eternall reproach of our Divines; whilest other profound C• erks of late greatly, as they conceive, to the advancement of Prelaty, are so earnestly meting out the Lydian proconsular Asia, to make good the prime metropolis of Ephesus, as if some of our Prelates in all haste meant to change their solle, and become neighbours to the English Bishop of Chalcedon; and whilest good Breerwood as busily bestirres himselfe in our vulgar tongue to divide precisely the three Patriarchats, of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch, and whether to any of these England doth belong, I shall in the meane while not cease to hope through the mercy and grace of Christ, the head and husband of his Church, that England shortly is to belong, neither to see Patriarchall, nor see Prelaticall, but to the faithfull feeding and disciplining of that ministeriall order, which the blessed Apostles constituted throughout the Churches: and this I sh• ll assay to prove can be no other, then that of Presbyters and Deacons. And if any man incline to thinke I undertake a taske too difficult for my yeares, I trust through the supreme inlightning assistance farre otherwise; for my yeares, be they few or many, what imports it? so they bring reason, let that be looke on: and for the task, from hence that the question in hand is so needfull to be known at this time chiefly by every meaner capacity, and containes in it the explication of many admirable and heavenly privileges reacht out to us by the Gospell, I conclude the task must be easie. God having to this end ordained his Gospell to be the revelation of his power and wisdome in Christ Jesus. And

this is one depth of his wisdome, that he could so plainly reveale so great a measure of it to the grosse distorted apprehension of decaied mankinde. Let others therefore dread and shun the scriptures for their darknesse, I shall wish I may deserve to be reckoned among those who admire and dwell upon them for their clearnesse. And this seemes to be the cause why in those places of holy writ, wherein is treated of Church-government, the reasons thereof are not formally, and profestly set downe, because to him that heeds attentively the drift and scope of Christian profession, they easily imply themselves, which thing further to explane, having now prefaced enough, I shall no longer deferre. CHAP. I. That Church-government is prescribed in the Gospell, and that to say otherwise is unsound. THe first and greatest reason of Church-government, we may securely with the assent of many on the adverse part, affirme to be, because we finde it so ordained and set out to us by the appointment of God in the scriptures; but whether this be Presbyteriall, or Prelaticall, it cannot be brought to the scanning, untill I have said what is meet to some who do not think it for the ease of their inconsequent opinions, to grant that Church discipline is platformed in the Bible, but that it is left to the discretion of men. To this conceit of theirs I answer, that it is both unsound and untrue. For there is not that thing in the world of more grave and urgent importance throughout the whole life of man, then is discipline. What need I instance? He that hath read with judgement, of Nations and commonwealths, of Cities and Camps, of peace and warre, sea and land, will readily agree that the flourishing and decaying of all civill societies, all the moments and turnings of humane occasions are moved to and fro as upon the axle of discipline. so that whatsoever power or sway in mortall things weaker men have attributed to fortune, I durst with more confidence (the honour of divine providence ever saved) ascribe either to the vigor, or the slacknesse of discipline. Nor is there any sociable perfection in this life

civill or sacred that can be above discipline, but she is that which with her musicall cords preserves and holds all the parts thereof together. Hence in those perfect armies of Cyrus in Xenophon, and scipio in the Roman stories, the excellence of military skill was esteemed, not by the not needing, but by the readiest submitting to the edicts of their commander. And certainly discipline is not only the removall of disorder, but if any visible shape can be given to divine things, the very visible shape and image of vertue, whereby she is not only seene in the regular gestures and motions of her heavenly paces as she walkes, but also makes the harmony of her voice audible to mortall eares. Yea the Angels themselves, in whom no disorder is feared, as the Apostle that saw them in his rapture describes, are distinguisht and quaternion• into their celestiall Princedomes, and satrapies, according as God himselfe hath writ his imperiall decrees through the great provinces of heaven. The state also of the blessed in Paradise, though never so perfect, is not therefore left without discipline, whose golden survaying reed marks out and measures every quarter and circuit of new Jerusalem. Yet is it not to be conceived that those eternall effluences of sanctity and love in the glorified saints should by this meanes be confined and cloied with repetition of that which is prescribed, but that our happinesse may or be it selfe into a thousand vagancies of glory and delight, and with a kinde of eccentricall equation be as it were an invariable Planet of joy and felicity, how much lesse can we believe that God would leave his fraile and feeble, though not lesse beloved Church here below to the perpetuall stumble of conjecture and disturbance in this our darke voyage without the card and compasse of Discipline. Which is so hard to be of mans making, that we may see even in the guidance of a civill state to worldly happinesse, it is not for every learned, or every wise man, though many of them consult in common, to invent or frame a discipline, but if it be at all the worke of man, it must be of such a one as is a true knower of himselfe, and himselfe in whom contemplation and practice, wit, prudence, fortitude, and eloquence must be rarely met, both to comprehend the hidden causes of things, and span in his thoughts all the various effects that passion or complexion can worke in mans nature; and hereto must his hand be at defiance with gaine, and his heart in all vertues heroick. so far is it from the kenne of these wretched projectors of ours that bescraull their Pamflets every day with new formes of government for our Church. And therefore all the ancient lawgivers were either truly

inspired as Moses, or were such men as with authority anough might give it out to be so, as Min• s, Lycurgus, Numa, because they wisely forethought that men would never quietly submit to such a discipline as had not more of Gods hand in it then mans: To come within the narrownesse of houshold government, observation will shew us many deepe counsellers of state and judges to demean themselves incorruptly in the setled course of affaires, and many worthy Preachers upright in their lives, powerfull in their audience; but look upon either of these men where they are left to their own disciplining at home, and you shall soone perceive for all their single knowledge and uprightnesse, how deficient they are in the regulating of their own family; not only in what may concerne the vertuous and decent composure of their minds in their severall places, but that which is of a lower and easier performance, the right possessing of the outward vessell, their body, in health or sicknesse, rest or labour, diet, or abstinence, whereby to render it more pliant to the soule, and use• ull to the commonwealth: which if men were but as good to disci• ne themselves, as some are to tutor their Horses and Hawks, it could not be so grosse in most housholds. If then it appear so hard and so little knowne, how to governe a house well, which is thought of so easie discharge, and for every mans undertaking, what skill of man, what wisdome, what parts, can be sufficient to give lawes & ordinances to the elect houshold of God? If we could imagine that he had left it at randome without his provident and gracious ordering, who is he so arrogant so presumptuous that durst dispose and guide the living arke of the holy Ghost; though he should finde it wandring in the field of Bethshemesh, without the conscious warrant of some high calling. But no profane insolence can paralell that which our Prelates dare avouch, to drive outragiously, and shatter the holy arke of the Church, not born upon their shoulders with pains and labour in the word, but drawne with rude oxen their officials, and their owne brute inventions. Let them make shewes of reforming while they will, so long as the Church is mounted upon the Prelaticall Cart, and not as it ought betweene the hands of the Ministers, it will but shake and totter, and he that sets to his hand though with a good intent to hinder the shogging of it, in this unlawfull waggonry wherein it rides, let him beware it be not fatall to him as it was to V• a. Certainly if God be the father of his family the Church, wherein could he expresse that name more, then in training it up under his owne all-wise and dear Oeconomy, not turning it loose to the havock of

strangers and wolves that would ask no better plea then this to do• in the Church of Christ, what ever humour, faction, policy, or •
         centious will would prompt them to. Againe, if Christ be the Churches husband expecting her to be presented before him a pure unspotted virgin; in what could he shew his tender love to her mo• then in prescribing his owne wayes which he best knew would be to the improvement of her health and beauty with much great• care doubtlesse then the Persian King could appoint for his Queen• 
         Esther, those maiden dietings & set prescriptions of baths, & odo• which may tender her at last the more amiable to his eye. For o• any age or sex, most unfitly may a virgin be left to an uncertaine and arbitrary education. Yea though she be well instructed, yet is she still under a more strait tuition, especially if betrothed. In like manner the Church bearing the same resemblance, it were not reason to think she should be left destitute of that care which is as necessary, and proper to her, as instruction. For publick preaching indeed is the gift of the spirit working as best seemes to his secret will, but discipline is the practick work o• preaching directed and applied as is most requisite to particular duty; without which it were all one to the benefit of souls, as it would be to the cure of bodi• s, if all the Physitians in London should get into the severall Pulpits of the City, and assembling all the diseased in every pari• should begin a learned Lecture of Pleurisies, Palsies, Lethargies, to which perhaps none there present were inclined, and so without so much as feeling one puls, or giving the least order to any skilfull Apothecary, should dismisse 'em from time to time, some groaning, some languishing, some expiring, with this only charge to look well to themselves, and do as they heare. Of what excellence and necessity then Church-discipline is, how beyond the faculty of man to frame, and how dangerous to be left to mans invention who would be every foot turning it to sinister ends, how properly also it is the worke of God as father, and of Christ as Husband of the Church; we have by thus much heard. CHAP. II. That Church governement is set downe in holy scripture, and that to say otherwise is untrue. As therefore it is unsound to say that God hath not appointed any set government in his Church, so is it untrue. Of the time

of the Law there can be no doubt; for to let passe the first institution of Priests and Levites, which is too cleare to be insisted upon, when the Temple came to be built, which in plaine judgement could breed no essentiall change either in religion, or in the Priestly government; yet God to shew how little he could endure that men should be tampring and contriving in his worship, though in things of lesse regard, gave to David for solomon not only a pattern and modell of the Temple, but a direction for the courses of the Priests and Levites, and for all the worke of their service. At the returne from the Captivity things were only restored after the ordinance of Moses and David; or if the least alteration be to be found, they had with them inspired men, Prophets, and it were not sober to say they did ought of moment without divine intimation. In the Prophesie of Ez-kiel from the 40 Chapt. onward, after the destruction of the Temple, God by his Prophet seeking to weane the hearts of the Jewes from their old law to expect a new and more perfect reformation under Christ, sets out before their eyes the stately fabrick & constitution of his Church, with al the ecclesiasticall functions appertaining; indeed the description is as sorted best to the apprehension of those times, typicall and shadowie, but in such manner as never yet came to passe, nor never must literally, unlesse we mean to annihilat the Gospel. But so exquisit and lively the description is in portraying the new state of the Church, and especially in those points where government seemes to be most active, that both Jewes and Gentiles might have good cause to be assured, that God when ever he meant to reforme his Church, never intended to leave the governement thereof delineated here in such curious architecture, to be patch't afterwards, and varnish't over with the devices and imbellishings of mans imagination. Did God take such delight in measuring out the pillars, arches, and doores of a materiall Temple, was he so punctuall and circumspect in lavers, altars, and sacrifices soone after to be abrogated, left any of these should have beene made contrary to his minde? is not a farre more perfect worke more agreeable to his perfection in the most perfect state of the Church militant, the new alliance of God to man? should not he rather now by his owne prescribed discipline have cast his line and levell upon the soule of man which is his rationall temple, and by the divine square and compasse thereof forme and regenerate in us the lovely shapes of vertues and graces, the sooner to edifie and accomplish that immortall stature of Christs body which is his Church, in all her glorious lineaments and proportions. 

And that this indeed God hath done for us in the Gospel 〈◊〉 shall see with open eyes, not under a vaile. We may passe over the history of the Acts and other places, turning only to those Epistle• of s. Paul to Timothy and Titus: where the spirituall eye may discerne more goodly and gracefully erected then all the magnifice• ce of Temple or Tabernacle, such a heavenly structure of evangel• ck discipline so diffusive of knowledge and charity to the prosperous increase and growth of the Church, that it cannot be wondered if that elegant and artfull symmetry of the promised new temple in Ezechiel, and all those sumptuous things under the Law were made to signifie the inward beauty and splendor of the Christian Church thus governed. And whether this be commanded let it now be j• dged. s. Paul after his preface to the first of Timothy which hee concludes in the 17 Verse with Amen, enters upon the subject of his Epistle which is to establish the Church-government with a command. This charge I commit to thee son Timothy: according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them might'st war a good warfare. Which is plain enough thus expounded. This charge I commit to thee wherein I now go about to instruct thee how thou shalt set up Church-discipline, that thou might'st warre a good warfare, bearing thy selfe constantly and faithfully in the Ministery, which in the I to the Corinthians is also called a warfare: and so after a kinde of Parenthesis concerning Hymenaeus he returnes to his command though under the milde word of exhorting, Cap. 2. v. 1. I exhort therefore. As if he had interrupted his former command by the occasionall mention of Hymeneus. More beneath in the 14 V. of the 3 C. when he hath delivered the duties of Bishops or Presbyters and Deacons not once naming any other order in the Church, he thus addes. These things write I unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly (such necessity it seems there was) but if I tarry long, that thou ma• 'st know how thou ought'st to behave thy s• lfe in the house of God. From this place it may be justly ask'• , whether Timothy by this here written might know what was to be knowne concerning the orders of Church-governours or no? If he might, then in such a cleere t• xt as this may we know too without further j• ngle; if he might not, then did s. Paul write insufficiently, and moreover said not true, for he saith here he might know, and I perswade my selfe he did know ere this was written, but that the Apostle had more regard to the instruction of us, then to the informing of him. In the fifth Chap. after some other Church precepts concerning discipline, mark what

a dreadfull command followes, Verse 21. I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect Angels, that thou observe these things, and as if all were not yet sure anough, • e closes up the Epistle, with an adj• ring charge thus. I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, that thou keepe this commandement: that is the whole commandement concerning discipline, being them ine purpose of the Epistle: although Hooker would faine have this denouncement referred to the particular precept going before, because the word Commandement is in the singular number, not remembring that even in the first Chapt. of this Epistle, the wo• Commandement is used in a plurall sense, Vers. 5. Now the end of the Commandement is charity. And what more frequent then in like manner to say the Law of Moses. so that either to restraine the significance too much, or too much to inlarg it would make the adjuration either not so waighty, or not so pertinent. And thus we find here that the rules of Church-discipline are not only commanded, but hedged about with such a terrible impalement of commands, as he that will break through wilfully to violate the least of them, must hazard the wounding of his conscience even to death. Yet all this notwithstanding we shall finde them broken wellnigh all by the faire pretenders even of the next ages. No lesse to the contempt of him whom they fain to be the archfounder of prelaty s. Peter, who by what he writes in the 5 Chap. of his first Epistle should seeme to be farre another man then tradition reports him: there he commits to the Presbyters only full authority both of feeding the flock, and Episcopating: and commands that obedience be given to them as to the mighty hand of God, wch is his mighty ordinance. Yet all this was as nothing to repell the ventrous boldnesse of innovation that ensued, changing the decrees of God that is immutable, as if they had been breathed by man. Neverthelesse when Christ by those visions of s. Iohn foreshewes the reformation of his Church, he bids him take his Reed, and meet it out againe after the first patterne, for he prescribes him no other. Arise, said the Angell, and measure the Temple of God and the Altar, and them that worship therein. What is there in the world can measure men but discipline? Our word ruling imports no lesse. Doctrine indeed is the measure, or at least the reason of the measure, tis true, but unlesse the measure be applied to that which it is to measure, how can it actually doe its proper worke. Whether therefore discipline be all one with doctrine, or the particular application thereof to this or that person,

we all agree that doctrine must be such only as is command• , or whether it be something really differing from doctrine, yet 〈◊〉 it only of Gods appointment, as being the most adequat measure of the Church and her children, which is here the office of a gr• Evangelist and the reed given him from heaven. But that par• of the Temple which is not thus measured, so farre is it from being 〈◊〉 Gods tuition or delight, that in the following verse he rejects i• , however in shew and visibility it may seeme a part of his Church, yet in as much as it lyes thus unmeasured he leaves it to be trampled by the Gentiles, that is to be polluted with idolatrous and Gentilish rites and ceremonies. And th• the principall reformation here foretold is already come to passe as well in discipline as in doctrine the state of our neighbour Churches afford us to behold. Thus through all the periods and changes of the Church it hath beene proved that God hath still reserved to himselfe the right of enacting Church-government. CHAP. III. That it is dangerous and unworthy the Gospell to hold that Church-government is to be patterned by the Law, as B. Andrews and the Primat of Armagh maintaine. 
         WE may returne now from this interposing difficulty thus removed, to affi• me, that since Church-government is so strictly commanded in Gods Word, the first and greatest reason why we should submit thereto, is because God hath so commanded. But whether of these two, Prelaty or Presbytery can prove it selfe to be supported by this first and greatest reason, must be the next dispute. Where in this position is to be first layd down as granted; that I may not follow a chase rather then a• argument, that one of these two, and none other is of Gods ordaining, and if it be, that ordinance must be evident in the Gospell. For the imperfect and obscure institution of the Law, which the Apostles themselves doubt not o• t-times to • ilifre, cannot give rules to the compleat and glorious ministration of the Gospell, which lookes on the Law, as on a childe, not as on a tutor. And that the Prelates have no sure foundation in the Gospell, their own guiltinesse doth manifest: they would not else run questing up as high as Adam to fe• h their originall, as tis said one of them lately did in publick. To

which assertion, had I heard it, because I see they are so insatiable of antiquity, I should have gladly assented, and confest them ye• more ancient. For Lucifer before Adam was the fir• prela• Angel, and both he, as is commonly thought, and our 〈◊〉 
         Adam, as we all know, for aspiring above their order• , were miser• bly degraded. But others better advised are content to receive their beginning from Aaron and his sons, among whom B. Andrews of late ye• res, and in these times the Primat of Armagh for their learning are reputed the best able to say what may be said in this opinion. The Primat in his discou• se about the originall of Episcopacy newly revised begins thus. The ground of Episco• cy is fetcht partly from the pattern prescribed by God in the old Testament, and partly from the imitation thereof brought in by the Apostles. Herein I must entreat to be excused of the desire I have to be satisfied, how for example the ground of Episcop. is fetch't partly from the example of the old Testament, by whom next, and by whose authority. secondly, how the Church-government under the Gospell can be rightly called an imitation of that in the old Testament? for that the Gospell is the end and fulfilling of the Law, our liberty also from the bondage of the Law I plainly reade. How then the ripe age of the Gospell should be put to schoole againe, and learn to governe her selfe from the infancy of the Law, the stronger to imitate the weaker, the freeman to follow the captive, the learned to be lessoned by the rude, will be a hard undertaking to evince from any of those principles which either art or inspiration hath written. If any thing done by the Apostles may be drawne howsoever to a likenesse of somethi• g Mosaicall, if it cannot be proved that it was done of purpose in imitation, as having the right thereof grounded in nature, and not in ceremony or type, it will little availe the matter. The whole Judaick law is either politicall, and to take pattern by that, no Christian nation ever thought it selfe o• ged in conscience; or morall, which containes in it the observation of whatsoever is substantially, and perpetually true and good, either in religion, or course of life. That which is thus morall, besides what we f• tch from those unwritten lawes and Ideas which nature hath ingraven in us, the Gospell, as stands with her dignity most, lectures to us from her own authentick hand-writing and command, not copies out from the borrowed manuscript of a subservient scrow• , by way of imitating. As well might she be said in her sacrame• of water to imitate the baptisme of Iohn. What though • he retaine excommunication • sed in the syna • ogue, retain the morality of the

sabbath, she does not therefore imitate the law her underling, but perfect her. All that was morally delivered from the law to the Gospell in the office of the Priests and Levites, was that there should be a ministery set a part to teach and discipline the Church; both which duties the Apostles thought good to commit to the Presbyters. And if any distinction of honour were to be made among them, they directed it should be to those not that only rule well, but especially to those that labour in the word and doctrine. By which we are taught that laborious teaching is the most honourable 1 Tim. 5• 
          Prelaty that one Minister can have above another in the Gospell: if therefore the superiority of Bishopship be grounded on the Priesthood as a part of the morall law, it cannot be said to be an imitation; for it were ridiculous that morality should imitate morality, which ever was the same thing. This very word of patterning or imitating excludes Episcopacy from the solid and grave Ethicall law, and betraies it to be a meere childe of ceremony, or likelier some misbegotten thing, that having pluckt the gay feathers of her obsolet bravery to • ide her own deformed barenesse, now vaunts and glories in her stolne plumes. In the meane while what danger there is against the very life of the Gospell to make in any thing the typical law her pattern, and how impossibl• in that which touches the Priestly government, I shall use such light as I have receaved, to lay open. • t cannot be unknowne by what expressions the holy Apostle s. Paul spar• s not to explane to us the na• ure and condition of the l• calling those o• dinances which were the chiefe and 〈◊〉 offices of the Priests, the elements and rudiments of the world both weake and beggarly. Now to br• ed, and bring up the child• en of the promise, the heirs of liberty and grace under such a kinde of government as is profest to be but an imitation of that ministery which engendered to b• ndage the so• s of Agar, how can this 〈◊〉 but a foul injury and derogation, if not a cancelling of that birth-r• ght and immunity which Christ hath purchased for us with his blood. For the ministration of the law consisting of c• all things, drew to it such a ministery as consisted of ca• all respects, dignity, precedence, and the like. And such a ministery establish't in the Gospell, as is founded upon the points and ter• of superiority, and nests it selfe in worldly honour, will draw to it, and we see it doth, such a religion as • unnes back againe to the old pompe and glory of the flesh. For doubtlesse there is a certaine attraction and magnetick force betwixt the religion and the ministeriall forme thereof. If the religion be pure, spirituall, simple, and

lowly, as the Gospel most truly is, such must the face of the ministery be. And in like manner if the forme of the Ministery be grounded in the worldly degrees of autority, honour, temporall jurisdiction, we see it with our eyes it will turne the inward power and purity of the Gospel into the outward carnality of the law; evaporating and exhaling the internall worship into empty conformities, and gay sh• wes. And what remains then but that wee should runne into as dangerous and deadly apostacy a• our lamented neighbours the Papists, who by this very snire and pitfall of imitating the ceremonial law, fel into that irrecoverable superstition, as must need• make void the cov• nant of salvation to them that persist in this blindnesse. CHAP. IV. That it is impossible to make the Priesthood of Aaron a pattern whereon to ground Episcopacy. 
         THat which was promised next, is to declare the impossibility of grounding Evangelick government in the imitation of the Jewish Priesthood: which will be done by considering both the quality of the persons, and the office it selfe. Aaron and his sonnes were the Princes of their Tribe before they were sanctified to the Priesthood: that personall eminence which they held above the other Levites, they receaved not only from their office, but partly brought it into their office: and so from that time forward the Priests were not chosen out of the whole number of the Levites, as our Bishops, but were borne inheritors of the dignity. Therefore unlesse we shall choose our Prelat• only out of the Nobility, and let them runne in a blood, there can be no possible imitation of Lording over their brethren in regard of their persons altogether unlike. As for the office wch was a representation of Christs own person more immediately in the high Priest, & of his whole priestly office in all the other; to the performance of wch the Levits were but as servitors & Deacons, it was necessary there should

be a distinction of dignity betweene two functions of so great od• . But there being no such difference among our Ministers, unlesse it be in reference to the Deacons, it is impossible to found a 〈◊〉 upon the imitation of this Priesthood. For wherein, or in w• worke is the office of a Prelat excellent above that of a Pa• in ordination you'l say; but flatly against scripture, for there we know Timothy receaved ordination by the hands of the Presby• y, notwithstanding all the vaine delusions that are used to 〈◊〉 that testimony, and maintaine an unwarrantable usurpation. But wherefore should ordination be a cause of setting up a superiour degree in the Church• is not that whereby Christ became our saviour a higher and greater worke, then that whereby he did ordai• e messengers to preach and publish him our saviour? Every Minister sustains the person of Christ in his highest work of communicating to us the mysteries of our salvation, and hath the power of binding and absolving, how should he need a higher dignity to represent or execute that which is an inferior work in Christ? why should the performance of ordination which is a lower office exalt a Prelat, and not the seldome discharge of a higher and more noble office 〈◊〉 is preaching & administring much rather depressehim? Verily neither the nature, nor the example of ordinationdoth any way require an imparity betweene the ordainer and the ordained. For what more naturall then every like to produce his like; man to beget man, fire to propagate fire, and in examples of highest opi••
         on the ordainer is inferior to the ordained; fo• the Pope is not ma• e by the precedent Pope, but by Cardinals, who ordain and consecrate to a higher and greater office then their own. CHAP. V. To the Arguments of B. Andrews and the Primat. 
         IT followes here to attend to certaine objections in a little treatise lately printed among others of like sort at Oxford, and in the title said to be out of the rude draughts of Bishop Andrews. And surely they bee rude draughts indeed, in so much that it is marvell to think what his friends meant to let come abroad such shallow reasonings with the name of a man so much bruited for learning. In the 12 and 23 pages he seemes most notoriously inconstant to himselfe; for in the former place he tels us he forbeares to take

any argument of Prelaty from Aaron, as being the type of Christ. In the latter he can forbeare no longer, but repents him of his rash gratuity, affirming, that to say, Christ being come in the flesh, his figure in the high Priest ceaseth, is the shift of an Anabaptist; and stiffly argues that Christ being as well King as Priest, was as well fore-resembled by the Kings then, as by the high Priest. so that if his comming take away the one type, it must also the other. Marvellous piece of divinity! and well worth that the land should pay six thousand pound a yeare for, in a Bishoprick, although I reade of no sophister among the Greeks that was so dear, neither Hippias nor Protagoras, nor any whom the socratick schoole famously refuted with out hire. Here we have the type of the King sowed to the typet of the Bishop, suttly to cast a jealousie upon the Crowne, as if the right of Kings; like M• ager in the Metamorphosis, were no longer lived then the firebrand of Prelaty. But more likely the Prelats fearing (for their own guilty carriage protests they doe feare) that their faire dayes cannot long hold, practize by possessing the King with this most false doctrine, to ingage his power for them, as in his owne quarrell, that when they fall they may fall in a generall ruine, just as cruell Tyberius would wish,When I dye, let the earth be rouled in flames. But where, O Bishop, doth the purpose of the law set forth Christ to us as a King? That which never was intended in the Law, can never be abolish'• as part thereof. When the Law was made, there was no King: if before the law, or under the law God by a speciall type in any King would foresignifie the fut• re kingdome of Christ, which is not yet visibly come, what was that to the law? The whole ceremoniall law, and types can be in no law else, comprehends nothing but the propitiatory office of Christs Priesthood, which being in substance accomplisht, both law and Priesthood fades away of it selfe, and passes into aire like a transitory vision, and the right of Kings neither stands by any type nor falls. We acknowledge that the civill magistrate weares an autority of Gods giving, and ought to be obeied as his vicegerent. But to make a King a type, we say is an abusive and unskilfull speech, and of a morall solidity makes it seeme a ceremoniall shadow. Therefore your typical chaine of King and Priest must unlink. But is not the type of Priest taken away by Christs comming? no saith this famous Protestant Bishop of Winchester; it is not, and he that saith it is, is an Anabaptist. What think ye Reade• , do ye not understand him? What can be gathered hence but that the Prelat would still sacrifice?

conceave him readers, he would missifi• ate. Their altar• indeed were in a fair forwardnesse; and by such arguments as th• they were setting up the molten Calfe of their Masseagaine, and of their great Hierarch the Pope. For if the type of Priest be not taken away, then neither of the high Priest, it were a strange behe• ding; and high Priest more then one there cannot be, and that o• e can be no lesse then a Pope. And this doubtlesse was the bent of his career, though never so covertly. Yea but there was something else in the high Priest besides the figure, as is plain by s. Pauls acknowledging him. Tis true that in the 17 of Deut, whence this autority arise• to the Priest in matters too hard for the secular judges, as must needs be many in the occasions of those times involved so with ceremoniall niceties, no wonder though it be commanded to enquire at the mouth of the Priests, who besides the Magistrat• their collegues had the Oracle of Uri• to consult with. And whether the high Priest Ananias had not incroach't beyond the limits of his Priestly autority, or whether used it rightly, was no time then for s. Paul to contest about. But if this instance be able to assert any right of jurisdiction to the Clergy, it must impart it in common to all Ministers, since it were a great folly to seeke for counsell in a hard intricat scruple from a Dunce Prelat, when there might be found a speedier solution from a grave and learned Mi• ister, whom God hath gifted with the judgement of Urim more amply oft-times then all the Prelates together; and now in the Gospell hath granted the privilege of this oraculous Ephod alike to all his Ministers. The reason therefore of imparity in the Priests, being now as is aforesaid, really annulled both in their person, and in their representative office, what right of jurisdiction soever, can be from this place Levitically bequeathed, must descend upon the Ministers of the Gospell equally, as it findes them in all other points equall. Well then he is finally content to let, Aaron go. El• r will serve his turne, as being a superior of superiors, and yet no type of Christ in Aarons life time. O thou that would'st winde into any figment, or phantasme to save thy Miter! Yet all this will not fadge, though it be cunningly interpolisht by some second hand with crooks & emendations; Heare then; the type of Christ in some one particular, as of entring yearly into the Holy of holies and such like, rested upon the High Priest only as more immediately personating our saviour: but to resemble his whole satisfactory office all the lineage of Aaron was no more then sufficient. And all, or any of the Priests considered separately without relation to the

highest, are but as a livelesse trunk and signifie nothing. And this shewes the excellente or Christs sacrifice, who at once and in one person fulfilled that which many hunderds of Priests many times repeating had anough to foreshew. What other imparity there was among themselves, we may safely suppose it depended on the dignity of their birth and family, together with the circumstances of a carnall service, which might afford many priorities. And this I take to be the summe of what the Bishop hath laid together to make plea for P• laty by imitation of the Law. I hough indeed, if it may stand, it will inferre Popedome all as well. Many other courses he tries, enforcing himselfe with much ostentation of endlesse genealogies, as if he were the man that s. Paul forewarnes us of in Timothy, but so unvigorously, that I do not feare his winning of many to his cause, but such as doting upon great names are either over-weake, or over sudden of faith. I shall not refuse therefore to lea• ne so much prudence as I finde in the Roman souldier that attended the crosse, not to stand breaking of legs, when the breath is quite out of the body, but passe to that which follows. The Primat of Armagh at the beginning of his tractat seeks to availe himselfe of that place in the 66 of Esaiah, I will take of them for Priests and Levites, saith the Lord; to uphold hereby such a forme of superiority among the ministers of the Gospell, succeeding those in the law, as the Lords day did the sabbath. But certain if this method may be admitted of interpreting those propheticall passages concerning Christian times in a punctuall correspondence, it may with equall probability be urged upon us, that we are bound to observe some monthly solemnity answerable to the new moons, as well as the Lords day which we keepe in lieu of the sabbath: for in the 23 v. the Prophet joynes them in the same manner together, as before he did the Priests and Levites, thus. And it shall come to passe that from one new moone to another, and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord. Undoubtedly with as good consequence may it be alledged from hence, that we are to solemnize some religious monthly meeting different from the sabbath, as from the other any distinct formality of Ecclesiasticall orders may be inferred. This rather will appeare to be the lawfull and unconstrained sense of the text, that God in taking of them for Priests and Levites, will not esteeme them unworthy though Gentiles, to undergoe any function in the Church, but will make of them a full and perfect ministery, as was that of the Priests

and Levites in their kinde. And Bishop An• rows himselfe to end the controversie, sends us a candid exposition of this quoted verse from the 24 page of his said book, plainly deciding that God by those legall names there of Priests and Levites means our Presbyters, and Deacons, for which either ingenuous confession, or slip of his pen we give him thanks, and withall to him that brought these treatises into one volume, who setting the contradictions of two learned men so neere together, did not foresee. What other deducements or analogies are cited out of s. Paul to pro• e a likenesse betweene the Ministers of the Old and New Testament, having tried their sinewes. I judge they may passe without harme doing to our cause. We may remember then that Prelaty neither hath nor can have foundation in the law, nor yet in the Gospell, which assertion as being for the plainnesse thereof a matter of eye sight, rather then of disquisition I voluntarily omitt, not forgetting to specifie this note againe, that the earnest des• e which the Prelates have to build their Hierarchy upon the sandy bottome of the law, gives us to see abundantly the little assurance which they finde to reare up their high roofs by the autority of the Gospell, repulst as it were from the writings of the Apostles, and driven to take sanctuary among the Jewes. Hence that open confession of the Primat before mentioned. Episcopacy is fetcht partly from the patterne of the Old Testament & partly from the New as an imitation of the Old, though nothing ca• be more rotten in Divinity then such a position as this, and is all one as to say Episcopacy is partly of divine institution, and partly of mans own carving. For who gave the autority to fetch more from the patterne of the law then what the Apostles had already fetcht, if they fetcht any thing at a• l, as hath beene proved they did not. so was Jer• oams Episcopacy partly from the patterne of the law, and partly from the patterne of his owne carnality; a parti-coloured and a parti-membered Episcopacy, and what can this be lesse then a monstrous? Others therefore among the Prelats perhaps not so well able to brook, or rather to justifie this foule relapsing to the old law, have condiscended at last to a plaine confessing that both the names and offices of Bishops and Presbyters at first were the same, and in the scriptures no where distinguisht. This grants the remonstrant in the fift section of his desc• e, and in the Preface to his last short answer. But what need respect he had whether he grant or grant it not, when as through all antiquity, and even in the lo• iest times of Prelaty we finde it granted. 

         Ierome the learned'st of the Fathers hides not his opinion, that custome only, which the Proverbe cals a tyrant, was the maker of Prelaty; before his audacious workman• p the Churches were ruled in common by the Presbyters, and such a certaine truth this was esteemed, that it became a decree among the Papall Canons compiled by Gratian. Ans• lme also of Canturbury, who to uphold the points of his Prelatisme made himselfe a traytor to his country, yet commenting the Epistles to Titus and the Philippians acknowledges from the cleernesse of the text, what Ierome and the Church Rubrick hath before acknowledged. He little dreamt then that the weeding-hook of reformation would after two ages pluck up his glorious poppy from insulting over the good corne. Though since some of our Brittish Prelates seeing themselves prest to produce scripture, try all their cunning, if the New Testament will not help them, to frame of their own heads as it were with wax a kinde of Mimick Bishop limmed out to the life of a dead Priesthood. Or else they would straine us out a certaine figurative Prelat, by wringing the collective allegory of those seven Angels into seven single Rochets. Howsoever since it thus appeares that custome was the creator of Prelaty being lesse ancient then the government of Presbyters, it is an extreme folly to give them the hearing that tell us of Bishops through so many ages: and if against their tedious muster of citations, sees, and successions, it be replied that wagers and Church antiquities, such as are repugnant to the plaine dictat of scripture are both alike the arguments of fooles, they have their answer. We rather are to cite all those ages to an arraignment before the word of God, wherefore, and what pretending, how presuming they durst alter that divine institution of Presbyter• , which the Apostles who were no various and inconstant men surely had set up in the Churches, and why they choose to live by custome and catalogue, or as s. Paul saith by sight and visibility, rather then by faith? But first I conclude from their owne mouthes that Gods command in scripture, which doubtlesse ought to be the first and greatest reason of Church-government, is wanting to Prelaty. And certainly we have plenteous warrant in the doctrine of Christ to determine that the want of this reason is of it selfe sufficient to confute all other pretences that may be brought in favour of it. CHAP. VI. That Prelaty was not set up for prevention of schisme, as is pretended, or if it were, that it performes not wh• t it was first set up for, but quite the contrary. YEt because it hath the outside of a specious reason, & specious things we know are aptest to worke with humane lightnesse and frailty, even against the soli• est truth, that sounds not plausibly, let us think it worth the examining for the love of infirmer Christians, of what importance this their second reason may be. Tradition they say hath taught them that for the prevention of growing schisme the Bishop was heaved above the Presbyter. And must tradition then ever thus to the worlds end be the perpetuall cankerworme to eat out Gods Commandements? are his decrees so inconsiderate and so fickle, that when the statutes of solon, or Lycurgus shall prove durably good to many ages, his in 40 yeares shall be found defective, ill contrived, and for needfull causes to be altered? Our saviour and his Apostles did not only foresee, but foretell and forewarne us to looke for schisme. Is it a thing to be imagined of Gods wisdome, or at least of Apostolick prudence to set up such a government in the tendernesse of the Church, as should incline, or not be more able then any other to oppose it selfe to schisme? it was well knowne what a bold lurker schisme was even in the houshold of Christ betweene his owne Disciples and those of Iohn the Baptistabo• fasting: and early in the Acts of the Apostles the noise of schisme had almost drowned the proclaiming of the Gospell; yet we rea• e not in scripture that any thought was had of making Prelates, no not in those places where dissention was most rife. If Prelaty had beene then esteemed a remedy against schisme, where was it more needfull then in that great variance among the Corinthians which s. Paul so laboured to reconcile? and whose eye could have found the fittest remedy sooner then his? and what could have made the remedy more available, then to have used it speedily? and lastly what could have beene more necessary then to have written it for our instruction? yet we see he neither commended it to us, nor used it himselfe. For the same division remaining there, or else bursting

forth againe more then 20 yeares after s. Pauls death, wee finde in Clements Epistle of venerable autority written to the yet factious Corinthians, that they were still governed by Presbyters. And the same of other Churches out of Hermas, and divers other the scholers of the Apostles by the late industry of the learned salmatius appeares. Neither yet did this worthy Clement s. Pauls disciple, though writing to them to lay aside schisme, in the least word advise them to change the Presbyteriall government into Prelaty. And therefore if God afterward gave, or permitted this insurrection of Episcopacy, it is to be feared he did it in his wrath, as he gave the Israelites a King. With so good a will doth he use to alter his own chosen government once established. For marke whether this rare device of mans braine thus prefe• ed before the ordinance of God, had better successe then fleshly wisdome not counseling with God is wont to have. so farre was it from removing schisme, that if schisme parted the congregations before, now it rent and mangled, now it • aged. Heresie begat heresie with a certaine monstrous haste of pregnancy in her birth, at once borne and bringing forth. Contentions before brotherly were now hostile. Men went to choose their Bishop as they went to a pitcht field, and the day of his election was like the sacking of a City, sometimes ended with the blood of thousands. Nor this among hereticks only, but men of the same beliefe, yea confessors, and that with such odious ambition, that Eusebius in his eighth book testifies he abhorred to write. And the reason is not obscure, for the poore dignity or rather burden of a • ochial Presbyter could not ingage any great party, nor that to any deadly feud: but Prelaty was a power of that extent, and sway, that if her election were popular, it was seldome not the cause of some faction or broil in the Church. But if her dignity came by favour of some Prince, she was from that time his creature, and obnoxious to comply with his ends in state were they right or wrong. so that in stead of finding Prelaty an impeacher of schisme or faction, the more I search, the more I grow into all perswasion to think rather that faction and she as with a spousall ring are wedded together, never to be divorc't. But here let every one behold the just, and dreadfull judgement of God meeting with the a• dacious pride of man that durst offer to mend the ordinances of heaven. God out of the strife of men brought forth by his Apostles to the Church that beneficent and ever distributing office of Deacons, the stewards and Ministers of holy almes,

man out of the pretended care of peace & unity being caught in the snare of his impious boldnesse to correct the will of Christ, brought forth to himselfe upon the Church that irreconcileable schisme of perdition and Apostasy, the Roman Antichrist: for that the exaltation of the Pope arose out of the reason of Prelaty it cannot be denied. And as I noted before that the patterne of the High Priest pleaded for in the Gospel (for take away the head Priest the rest are but a carcasse) sets up with better reason a Pope, then an Archbishop, for if Prelaty must still rise and rise till it come to a Primat, why should it stay there? when as the catholick government is not to follow the division of kingdomes, the temple best representing the universall Church, and the High Priest the universall head; so I observe here, that if to quiet schisme there must be one head of Prelaty in a land or Monarchy rising from a Provinciall to a nationall Primacy, there may upon better grounds of repressing schisme be set up one catholick head over the catholick Church. For the peace and good of the Church is not terminated in the schismelesse estate of one or two kingdomes, but should be provided for by the joynt consultation of all reformed Christendome: that all controversie may end in the finall pronounce or canon of one Arch-primat, or P• otestant Pope. Although by this meanes for ought I see, all the diameters of schisme may as well meet and be knit up in the center of one grand falshood. Now let all impartiall men arbitrate what goodly inference these two maine reasons of the Prelats have, that by a naturall league of consequence make more for the Pope then for themsel• . Yea to say more home are the very wombe for a new subantichrist to breed in; if it be not rather the old force and power of the same man of sin counterfeiting protestant. It was not the prevention of schisme, but it was schisme it selfe, and the hatefull thirst of Lording in the Church that first bestowed a being upon P• elaty; this was the true cause, but the pretence is stil the same. The Prelates, as they would have it thought, are the only mawls of schisme. Forsooth if they be put downe, a deluge of innumerable sects will follow; we shall be all Brownists, Familists Anabaptists. For the word P• ritan seemes to be quasht, and all that heretofore were counted such, are now Brownists. And thus doe they raise an evill report upon the expected reforming grace that God hath bi• us hope for, like those faithlesse spie• , whose carcasses shall perish in the wildernesse of their owne confused ignorance, and never taste the good of reformation. Doe they

keep away schisme? if to bring a num and chil stupidity of soul, an unactive blindnesse of minde upon the people by thei• leaden doctrine, or no doctrine at all, if to persecure all knowing and zealous Christians by the violence of their courts, be to keep away schisme, they keep away schisme indeed; and by this kind of discipline all Italy and spaine is as p• ely and politickly kept from schisme as England hath beene by them. With as good a plea might the dead pal• boast to a man, ti• I that free you from stitches and paines, and the troublesome feeling of cold & heat, of wounds and strokes; if I were gone, all these would molest you. The Winter might as well vaunt it selfe against the spring, I destroy all noysome and rank weeds, I keepe downe all pestilent vapours. Yes and all wholesome herbs, and all fresh dews, by your violent & hid • bound frost; but when the gentle west winds shall open the fruitfull bosome of the earth thus over-gird• d by your imprisonment, then the flowers put forth and spring and then the s• ne shall scatter the mists, and the ma• ing hand of the Tiller shall roo• up all that burdens the soile without thank to your bondage. But farre worse then any frozen captivity is the bondage of P• elates, for that other, if it keep down any thing which is good, within the earth, so doth it likewise that which is ill, but these let out freely the ill, and keep down the good, or else keepe downe the less• r ill, and let out the greatest. Be ashamed at last to tell the parliament ye curbe schismaticks, when as they know ye cherish and side with Papists, and are now as it were one party with them, and tis said they helpe to petition for ye. Can we believe that your government strains in good earnest at the petty g• ats of schisme, when as we see it makes nothing to swallow the Camel heresie of Rome; but that indeed your throat• are of the righ• Pharisaical straine. Where are those schismaticks with whom the Prelats hold such hot skirmish? shew us your acts, those glorious annals which your Courts of loathed memory lately deceased have left us? those schismaticks I doubt me wil be found the most of them such a• whose only schisme was to have spoke the truth against your high abominations and cruelties in the Church; this is the schisme ye hate most, the removall of your criminous Hierarchy. A politick government of yours, and of a pleasant conceit, set up to remove those as a pretended schisme, that would remove you as a palpable heresie in government. If the schisme would pardon ye that, she might go jagged in as many cuts and • lashes as she pleased for you. As for the rending of the Church, we have many

reasons to thinke it is not that which ye labour to prevent so much as the rending of your pontificall sleeves: that schisme would be the sorest schisme to you, that would be Brownisme and An•
         baptisme indeed. If we go downe, say you, as if Adrians wall were broke, a flood of sects will rush in. What sects? What are their opinions? give us the Inventory; it will appeare both by your former prosecutions and your present instances, that they are only such to speake of as are offended with your lawlesse government, your ceremonies, your Liturgy, an extract of the Masse book transl• ted. But that they should be contemners of publick prayer, and Churches used without superstition, I trust God will manifest it ere long to be as false a sl• nder, as your former slanders against the scots. Noise it till ye be hoarse; that a rabble of sects will come in, it will be answered ye, no rabble sir Priest, but a unanimous multitude of good Protestants will then joyne to the Church, which now because of you stand separated. This will be the dreadfull consequence of your removall. As for those terrible names of sectaries and schismaticks which ye have got together, we know your manner of fight, when the quiver of your arguments which it ever thin, and weakly stored, after the first brunt is quite empty, your course is to be take ye to your other quiver of slander, wherein lyes your best archery. And whom ye could not move by sophisticall arguing, them you thinke to confute by scandalous misnaming. Thereby inciting the blinder sort of people to mislike and deride sound doctrine and good christianity under two or three vile • nd hatefull terms. But if we could easily indure and dissolve your doubtiest reasons in argument, we shall more easily beare the w• rst of your unreasonablenesse in calumny and false report. Especially being foretold by Christ, that if he our Master were by your predecessors cal• ed samaritan and Belzebub, we must not think it strange if his best Disciples in the reformation, as at first by those of your tribe they were called Lollards and Hussites, so now by you be termed Puritans, and Brownists. But my hope is that the people of England will not suffer themselves to be juggled thus out of their faith and religion by a mist of names cast before their eyes, but will search wisely by the scriptures, and look quite through this fraudulent aspersion of a disgracefull name into the things themselves: knowing that the Primitive Christians in their times were accounted such as are now called Familists and Adamites, or worse. And many on the Prelatickside like the Church of sardis have a name

to live, and yet are dead; to be Protestants, and are indeed Papists in most of their principles. Thu• perswaded, this your old fallacy wee shall soone unmask, and quickly apprehend how you prevent schisme, and who are your schismatick• . But what if ye prevent, and hinder all good means of preventing schisme? that way which the Apostles used, was to call a councell; from which by any thing that can be learnt from the fifteenth of the Acts, no faithfull Christian was debarred, to whom knowledge and piety might give entrance. Of such a councell as this every parochiall Consistory is a right homogeneous and constituting part being in it selfe as it were a little synod, and towards a generall assembly moving upon her own basis in an even and firme progression, as those smaller squares in battell unite in one great cube, the main phalanx, an embleme of truth and stedfastnesse. Whereas on the other side Prelaty ascending by a graduall monarchy from Bishop to Arch-bishop, from thence to P imat, and from thence, for there can be no reason yeilded neither in nature, nor in religion, wherefore, if it have lawfully mounted thus high, it should not be a Lordly ascendent in the horoscope of the Church, from Primate to Patriarch, and so to Pope. I say Prelaty thus ascending in a continuall pyramid upon pretence to perfect the Churches unity, if notwithstanding it be found most needfull, yea the utmost helpe to dearn up the rents of schisme by calling a councell, what does it but teach us that Prelaty is of no force to effect this work which she boasts to be her maister-peice; and that her pyramid aspires and sharpens to ambition, not to • erfection, or unity. This we know, that as often as any great schisme disparts the Church, and synods be proclamed, the Presbyters • ve as great right there, and as free vote of old, as the Bishops, which the Canon law conceals not. so that Prelaty if she will seek to close up divisions in the Church, must be forc't to dissolve, and unmake her own pyramidal figure, which she affi• mes to be of such • niting power, when as indeed it is the most dividing, and schism• icall forme that Geometricians know of, and must be faine to inglobe, or incube her selfe among the Presbyters; which she hating to do, sends her haughty Prelates from all parts with their fork• d Miters, the badge of schisme or the stampe of his clov• n foot whom they serve I think, who according to their hierarchies ac• nating still higher and higher in a cone of Prelaty, in stead of healing up the gas• es of the Church, as it happens in such pointed bodies m• eting, fall to gore on• another with their sharpe

spires for upper place, and precedence, till the councell it 〈◊〉 prove the greatest schisme of all. And thus they are so farre fro• hindring dissention, that they have made unprofitable, and eve• noysome the chiefest remedy we have to keep Christendom at one, which is by councels: and these if wee rightly consider Apostolick example, are nothing else but generall Presbyteries. This seemed so farre from the Apostles to think much of, as if hereby their dignity were impaired, that, as we may gather by those Epistles of Peter and Iohn, which are likely to be latest written, when the Church grew to a setling, like those heroick patricians of Rome (if we may use such comparison) hasting to lay downe their dictatorship, they rejoys't to call themselves and to be as fellow Elders among their brethren. Knowing that their high office was but as the scaffolding of the Church yet unbuilt, and would be but a troublesome disfigurement, so soone as the building was finis• . But the losty minds of an age or two after, such was their small discerning, thought it a poore indignity, that the high reared government of the Church should so on a sudden, as it seemed to them, squat into a Presbytery. Next or rather before councels the timeliest prevention of schisme is to preach the Gospell abundantly and powerfully throughout all the land, to instruct the youth religiously, to endeavour how the scriptures may be easiest understood by all men; to all which the proceedings of these men have been on set purpose contrary. But how O Prelats should you remove schisme, and how should you not remove and oppose all the meanes of removing schism? when Prelaty is a schisme it selfe from the most reformed and most flourishing of our neighbour Churches abroad, and a sad subject of discord and offence to the whole nation 〈◊〉 home. The remedy which you alledge is the very disease we groan under; and never can be to us a remedy but by removing it selfe. Your predecessors were believed to assume this preeminence above their brethren only that they might appease dissention. Now God and the Church cals upon you, for the same reason to lay it down, as being to thousands of good men offensive, burdensome, intolerable. surrender that pledge which unlesse you sowlely us• rpt it, the Church gave you, and now claimes it againe, for the reason she first lent it. Discharge the trust committed to you prevent schisme, and that yeoan never do, but by discha• ging your selves. That government which ye hold, we con• esse pr• s much, hinders much 〈◊〉 move• much, but what th• 
         〈◊◊◊〉 of the Church? — no,

but all the peace and unity, all the welfare not of the Church alone, but of the whole kingdome. And if it be still permitted ye to hold, will cause the most sad I know not whether separation be anough to say, but such a wide gulph of distraction in this land as will never close her dismall gap, untill ye be forc't (for of your selv• ye wil never do as that Roman Curtius nobly did) for the Churches peace & your countries, to leap into the midst, and be no more seen. By this we shal know whether yours be that ancient Prelaty which you say was first constituted for the reducement of quiet & unanimity into the Church, for thē you wil not delay • o prefer that above your own preferment. If otherwise, we must be confident that your Prelaty is nothing else but your ambition, an insole• t preferring of your selves above your brethren, and all your learned scraping in antiquity even to disturbe the bones of old Aaron and his sonnes in their graves, is but to maintain and set upon our necks a stately and severe dignity, which you call sacred, and is nothing in very deed but a grave and reverent gluttony, a sanctimonious avarice, in comparison of which, all the duties and dearnesses which ye owe to God or to his Church, to law, custome, or nature, ye have resolved to set at nought. I could put you in mind what counsell Clement a fellow labourer with the Apostles gave to the Presbyters of Corinth, whom the people though unjustly sought to remove. Who among you saith he, is noble minded, who is pittifull, who is charitable, let him say thus, if for me this sedition, this enmity, these differences be, I willingly depart, I go my wayes, only let the flock of Christ be at peace with the Presbyters that are set over it. He that shall do this, saith he, shall get him great honour in the Lord, and all places will receave him. This was Clements counsell to good and holy men that they should depart rather from their just office, then by their stay, to ravle out the seamlesse garment of concord in the Church. But I have better counsell to give the Prelats, and farre more acceptable to their cares, this advice in my opinion is fitter for them. Cling fast to your Pontificall sees, bate not, quit your selves like Barons, stand to the utmost for your haughty Courts and votes in Parliament. still tell us that you prevent schisme, though schisme and combustion be the very issue of your bodies your first born; and set your country a bleeding in a Prelaticall mutiny, to fight for your pompe, and that ill favoured weed of temporall honour that sits dishonourably upon your laick shoulders, that ye may be fat and fleshy, swo• with high thoughts

and big with mischievous designes, when God comes to visit 〈◊〉 you all this forescore yeares vexation of his Church under your Egyptian tyranny. For certainly of all those blessed soules which you have persecuted, and those miserable ones which you have lost; the just vengeance does not sleepe. CHAP. VII. That those many sects and schismes by some supposed to be among us, and that rebellion in Ireland, oug• t not to be a hindrancc, but a hastning of reformation. 
         As for those many sects and divisions rumored abroad to be amongst us, it is not hard to perceave that they are partly the meere fictions and false alarmes of the Prelates, thereby to cast amazements and panick terrors into the hearts of weaker Christians that they should not venture to change the present deformity of the Church for fear of I know not what worse inconveniencies. With the same objected feares and suspicions, we know that suttle Prelat Gardner sought to divert the first reformation. It may suffice us to be taught by s. Paul that there must be f• cts for the manifesting of those that are sound hearted. These are but winds and flaws to try the floting vessell of our faith whether it be stanch and sayl well, whether our ballast be just, our anchorage and cable strong. By this is seene who lives by faith and certain knowledge, and who by credulity and the prevailing opinion of the age; whose vertue is of an unchangeable graine, and whose of a slight wash. If God come to trie our constancy we ought not to shrink, or stand the lesse firmly for that, but passe on with more stedfast resolution to establish the truth though it were through a lane of sects and heresies o• each side. Other things men do to the glory of God: but sects and errors it seems God suffers to be for the glory of good men, that the world may know and reverence their true fortitude and undaunted constancy in the truth. Let • s not therefore make these things an incumbrance, or an excuse of our delay in reforming which God sends us as an incitement to proceed with more honour and alacrity. For if there were no opposition where were the triall of an unfai• d goodnesse and magnanimity? vertue that wavers is 〈◊〉 vertue,

but vice revolted from i• selfe, and after a while returning. Th• actions of just and pious men do not darken in their middle course but solomon tels us they are as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfet day. But if we shall suffer the trifling doubts and jealousies of future sects to overcloud the faire beginnings of purpos'st reformation, let us rather fear that another proverb of the same Wiseman be not up• ided to us, that the way of the wicked is as darknesse, they stumble at they know not what. If sects and schismes be turbulent in the unse• led estate of a Church, while it lies under the amending hand, it best beseems our Christian courage to think they are but as the throws and pangs that go before the birth of reformation, and that the work it selfe is now in doing. For if we look but on the nature of elementall and mixt things, we know they cannot suffer any change of one kind o• quality into another without the struggl of contrarietie• . And in thing• artificiall, seldome any elegance is wrought without a superfluous wast and refuse in the transaction. No Marble statue can be po• itely carved, no fair edifice built without almost as much • bbish and sweeping. Insomuch that even in the spirituall conflict of s. Pauls conversion there fell scales from his eyes that were not perceaved before. No wonder then in the reforming of a Church which is never brought to effect without the fierce encounter of truth and fashood together, if, as it were the splinters and shares of so violent a jousting, there fall from between the shock many fond errors and fanatick opinions, which when truth has the upper hand, and the reformation shall be perfet• d, will easily be rid out of the way, or kept so low, as that they shall be only the exercise of our knowledge, not the disturbance, or interruption of our faith. As for that which Barcl• y in his image of minds writes concerning the horrible and barbarous conceits of Englishmen in their religion. I deeme it spoken like what hee was, a fugitive Papist traducing the Hand whence he sprung. It may be more judiciously gathered from hence, that the Englishman of many other nations is least atheisticall, and bears a naturall disposition of much reverence and awe towards the Deity; but in hi• weaknesse and want of better instruction, which among us too f•
         quently is neglected, especially by the meaner sort turning the b• nt of his own wits with a scrupulous and ceaselesse care what he might do to informe himselfe a right of God and his worship, he may fall not unlikely sometimes as any otherland man into an uncouth

opinion. And verily if we look • t his native towardli• sse i• the roughcast without breeding, some nation or other may haply be better composed to a naturall civility, and right judgement the• he. But if he get the benefit once of a wise and well rectified •
         ture, which must first come in generall from the godly vigilance of the Church, I suppose that where ever mention is made of countries manners, or men, the English people among the first that shall be praised, may deserve to be accounted a right pious, right honest, and right hardy nation. But thus while some stand dallying and deferring to reform for fear of that which should mainly hasten them forward, lest schism and error should encrease, we may now thank our selves and our delayes if instead of schism a bloody and inhumane rebellion be strook in between our slow movings. Indeed against violent and powerfull opposition there can be no just blame of a lingring dispatch. But this I urge against those that discourse it for a maxim, as if the swift opportunities of establishing, or reforming religion, were to attend upon the • eam of state businesse. In state many things at first are crude and hard to digest, which only time and deliberation can supple, and concoct. But in religion wherein i• no immaturity, nothing out of season, it goes farre otherwise. The doore of grace turnes upon smooth hinges wide opening to send out, but soon shutting to recall the precious offers of mercy to a nation: which unlesse Watchfulnesse and Zeale two quick-sighted and ready-handed Virgins be there in our behalfe to receave, we loose: and still the of• er we loose, the straiter the doore opens, and the lesse is offered. This is all we get by demurring in Gods service. Tis not rebellion that ought to be the hindrance of reformation, but it is the want of this which is the cause of that. The Prelats which boast themselves the only bridle• of schisme God knows have been so cold and backward both there and with us to represse heresie and idolatry, that either through their carelessenesse or their craft all this mischiefe is befal• . What can the Irish subject do lesse in Gods just displeasure against us, then revenge upon English bodies the little care that our Prelate have had of their souls. Nor hath their negligence been new in that Iland but ever notorious in Queen Elizabeths dayes, as Camden their known friend forbears not to complain. Yet so little are they touch• with remorce of these their cruelties, for these cruelties are theirs, the bloody revenge of those souls which they have fami• ht, that wh• s against our brethren the scot• , who by their upright and loyall

and loyall deed• have now bought themselves a• honourable name to posterity, whatsoever malice by slander could invent, rag• i• hostility attempt, they greedily attempted, toward these murd• ous Irish the enemies of God and mankind, a cursed off-spring of their own connivence, no man takes notice but that they seeme to be very calmely and indifferently affected. Where then should we begin to extinguish a rebellion that hath his cause from the misgovernment of the Church, where? but at the Churches reformation, and the removall of that government which pe• sues and war• es with all good Christians under the name of schismaticks, but maintains and fosters all Papists and Idolaters 〈◊〉 tolerable Christians. And if the sacred Bible may be our light, we are neither without example, nor the witnesse of God himselfe, that the corrupted estate of the Church is both the cause of tumult, and civill warres, and that to stint them, the peace of the Church must first be s• led. Now for a long season, saith Azariah to King Asa, Israel hath 〈◊〉 without the true God, and without a teaching Priest, and without, law; and in those times there was no peace to him that went out, • or to hi• that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabit• nts of the countries. And nation was destroied of nation, and City of City, f• God did vex them with all adversity. Be ye strong therefore, saith he to the reformers of that age, and let not your hands be weake, for your worke shall bee rewarded. And in those Prophets that lived in the times of reformation after the Captivity often doth God stirre up the people to consider that while establishment of Church matters was neglected, and put off, there was no peace to him that went out or came in, for I, saith God, had set all men every one against his neigbour. 
         Zechar. 8. But from the very day forward that they went seriously, and effectually about the welfare of the Church, he tels them that they Haggai 2. themselves might perceave the sudden change of things into a prosperous and peacefull condition. But it will here be said that the reformation is a long work, and the miseries of Ireland are urgent of a speedy redresse. They be indeed; and how speedy we are, the poore afflicted remnant of our martyred countrymen that sit there on the sea-shore, counting the houres of our delay with their sighs, and the minuts with their falling teares, perhaps with the destilling of their bloody wounds, if they have not quite by this time cast off, and almost curst the vain hope of our foundered ships, and aids, can best judge how speedy we are to their reliefe. But let their succors be hasted, as all need and reason is, and let not therefore the reformation

which is the chiefest cause of successe and victory be still procrastinated. They of the captivity in their greatest extremities could find both counsell and hands anough at once to build, and to expect the enemies assault. And we for our parts a populous and mighty nation must needs be faln into a strange plight either of effeminacy, or confusion, if Ireland that was once the conquest of one single Earle with his privat forces, and the small assistance of a petty Kernish Prince, should now take up all the wisdome and prowesse of this potent Monarchy to quell a barbarous crew of r• bels, whom if we take but the right course to subdue, that is beginning at the reformation of our Church, their own horrid murders and rapes, will so fight against them, that the very sutler• and horse boyes of the Campe will be able to rout and chase them without the staining of any Noble sword. To proceed by other method in this enterprize, be our Captains and Commanders never so expert, will be as great an error in the art o• warre, as any novice in souldiership ever committed. And thus I leave it as a declared truth, that neither the feare of sects no nor rebellion can be a fit plea to stay reformation, but rather to push it forward with all possible diligence and speed. "
"3","THE PREFACE. IN the publishing of humane lawes, which for the most part aime not beyond the good of civill society, to set them barely forth to the people without reason or Preface, like a physicall prescript, or only with threatnings, as it were a lordly command, in the judgement of Plato was thought to be done neither generously nor wisely. His advice was, seeing that persuasion certainly is a more winning, and more manlike way to keepe men in obedience then feare, that to such lawes as were of principall moment; there should be used as an induction, some well tempered discourse, shewing how good, how gainfull, how happy it must needs be to live according to honesty and justice, which being uttered with those native colours and graces of speech, as true eloquence the daughter of vertue can best bestow upon her mothers praises, would so incite, and in a manner, charme the multitude into the love of that which is really good, as to imbrace it ever after, not of custome and awe, which most men do, but of choice and purpose, with true and constant delight. But this practice we may learn, from a better & more ancient authority, then any heathen writer hath to give us, and indeed being a point of so high wisdome & worth, how could it be but we should find it in that book, within whose sacred context all wisdome is infolded? Moses therefore the only Lawgiver that we can believe to have beene visibly taught of God, knowing how vaine it was to write lawes to men whose hearts were not first seasoned with the knowledge of God and of his workes, began from the book of Genesis, as a prologue to his lawer; which Josephus 
         • ight well hath noted. That the nation of the Jewes, reading therein the universall goodnesse of God to all creatures in the Creation, and his peculiar favour to them in his election of Abraham their ancestor, from

whom they could derive so many blessings upon themselves, might be moved to obey si cerely by knowing so good a reason of their obedience. If then in the administration of civill justice, and under the obscurity of Ceremoniall rites, such care was had by the wisest of the heathen, and by Moses among the Jewes, to instruct them at least in a generall reason of that government to which their subjection was required, how much more ought the members of the Church under the Gospell seek• to informe their understanding in the reason of that government which the Church claimes to have over them: especially for that the Church hath in her immediate cure those inner parts and affections of the mind where the seat of reason is; having power to examine our spirituall knowledge, and to demand from us in Gods behalfe a service intirely reasonable. But because about the manner and order of this government, whether it ought to be Presbyteriall, or Prelaticall, such endlesse question, or rather uproare is arisen in this land, as may be justly termed, what the feaver is to the Physitians, the eternall reproach of our Divines; whilest other profound C• erks of late greatly, as they conceive, to the advancement of Prelaty, are so earnestly meting out the Lydian proconsular Asia, to make good the prime metropolis of Ephesus, as if some of our Prelates in all haste meant to change their solle, and become neighbours to the English Bishop of Chalcedon; and whilest good Breerwood as busily bestirres himselfe in our vulgar tongue to divide precisely the three Patriarchats, of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch, and whether to any of these England doth belong, I shall in the meane while not cease to hope through the mercy and grace of Christ, the head and husband of his Church, that England shortly is to belong, neither to see Patriarchall, nor see Prelaticall, but to the faithfull feeding and disciplining of that ministeriall order, which the blessed Apostles constituted throughout the Churches: and this I sh• ll assay to prove can be no other, then that of Presbyters and Deacons. And if any man incline to thinke I undertake a taske too difficult for my yeares, I trust through the supreme inlightning assistance farre otherwise; for my yeares, be they few or many, what imports it? so they bring reason, let that be looke on: and for the task, from hence that the question in hand is so needfull to be known at this time chiefly by every meaner capacity, and containes in it the explication of many admirable and heavenly privileges reacht out to us by the Gospell, I conclude the task must be easie. God having to this end ordained his Gospell to be the revelation of his power and wisdome in Christ Jesus. And

this is one depth of his wisdome, that he could so plainly reveale so great a measure of it to the grosse distorted apprehension of decaied mankinde. Let others therefore dread and shun the scriptures for their darknesse, I shall wish I may deserve to be reckoned among those who admire and dwell upon them for their clearnesse. And this seemes to be the cause why in those places of holy writ, wherein is treated of Church-government, the reasons thereof are not formally, and profestly set downe, because to him that heeds attentively the drift and scope of Christian profession, they easily imply themselves, which thing further to explane, having now prefaced enough, I shall no longer deferre. "
"4","CHAP. I. That Church-government is prescribed in the Gospell, and that to say otherwise is unsound. THe first and greatest reason of Church-government, we may securely with the assent of many on the adverse part, affirme to be, because we finde it so ordained and set out to us by the appointment of God in the scriptures; but whether this be Presbyteriall, or Prelaticall, it cannot be brought to the scanning, untill I have said what is meet to some who do not think it for the ease of their inconsequent opinions, to grant that Church discipline is platformed in the Bible, but that it is left to the discretion of men. To this conceit of theirs I answer, that it is both unsound and untrue. For there is not that thing in the world of more grave and urgent importance throughout the whole life of man, then is discipline. What need I instance? He that hath read with judgement, of Nations and commonwealths, of Cities and Camps, of peace and warre, sea and land, will readily agree that the flourishing and decaying of all civill societies, all the moments and turnings of humane occasions are moved to and fro as upon the axle of discipline. so that whatsoever power or sway in mortall things weaker men have attributed to fortune, I durst with more confidence (the honour of divine providence ever saved) ascribe either to the vigor, or the slacknesse of discipline. Nor is there any sociable perfection in this life

civill or sacred that can be above discipline, but she is that which with her musicall cords preserves and holds all the parts thereof together. Hence in those perfect armies of Cyrus in Xenophon, and scipio in the Roman stories, the excellence of military skill was esteemed, not by the not needing, but by the readiest submitting to the edicts of their commander. And certainly discipline is not only the removall of disorder, but if any visible shape can be given to divine things, the very visible shape and image of vertue, whereby she is not only seene in the regular gestures and motions of her heavenly paces as she walkes, but also makes the harmony of her voice audible to mortall eares. Yea the Angels themselves, in whom no disorder is feared, as the Apostle that saw them in his rapture describes, are distinguisht and quaternion• into their celestiall Princedomes, and satrapies, according as God himselfe hath writ his imperiall decrees through the great provinces of heaven. The state also of the blessed in Paradise, though never so perfect, is not therefore left without discipline, whose golden survaying reed marks out and measures every quarter and circuit of new Jerusalem. Yet is it not to be conceived that those eternall effluences of sanctity and love in the glorified saints should by this meanes be confined and cloied with repetition of that which is prescribed, but that our happinesse may or be it selfe into a thousand vagancies of glory and delight, and with a kinde of eccentricall equation be as it were an invariable Planet of joy and felicity, how much lesse can we believe that God would leave his fraile and feeble, though not lesse beloved Church here below to the perpetuall stumble of conjecture and disturbance in this our darke voyage without the card and compasse of Discipline. Which is so hard to be of mans making, that we may see even in the guidance of a civill state to worldly happinesse, it is not for every learned, or every wise man, though many of them consult in common, to invent or frame a discipline, but if it be at all the worke of man, it must be of such a one as is a true knower of himselfe, and himselfe in whom contemplation and practice, wit, prudence, fortitude, and eloquence must be rarely met, both to comprehend the hidden causes of things, and span in his thoughts all the various effects that passion or complexion can worke in mans nature; and hereto must his hand be at defiance with gaine, and his heart in all vertues heroick. so far is it from the kenne of these wretched projectors of ours that bescraull their Pamflets every day with new formes of government for our Church. And therefore all the ancient lawgivers were either truly

inspired as Moses, or were such men as with authority anough might give it out to be so, as Min• s, Lycurgus, Numa, because they wisely forethought that men would never quietly submit to such a discipline as had not more of Gods hand in it then mans: To come within the narrownesse of houshold government, observation will shew us many deepe counsellers of state and judges to demean themselves incorruptly in the setled course of affaires, and many worthy Preachers upright in their lives, powerfull in their audience; but look upon either of these men where they are left to their own disciplining at home, and you shall soone perceive for all their single knowledge and uprightnesse, how deficient they are in the regulating of their own family; not only in what may concerne the vertuous and decent composure of their minds in their severall places, but that which is of a lower and easier performance, the right possessing of the outward vessell, their body, in health or sicknesse, rest or labour, diet, or abstinence, whereby to render it more pliant to the soule, and use• ull to the commonwealth: which if men were but as good to disci• ne themselves, as some are to tutor their Horses and Hawks, it could not be so grosse in most housholds. If then it appear so hard and so little knowne, how to governe a house well, which is thought of so easie discharge, and for every mans undertaking, what skill of man, what wisdome, what parts, can be sufficient to give lawes & ordinances to the elect houshold of God? If we could imagine that he had left it at randome without his provident and gracious ordering, who is he so arrogant so presumptuous that durst dispose and guide the living arke of the holy Ghost; though he should finde it wandring in the field of Bethshemesh, without the conscious warrant of some high calling. But no profane insolence can paralell that which our Prelates dare avouch, to drive outragiously, and shatter the holy arke of the Church, not born upon their shoulders with pains and labour in the word, but drawne with rude oxen their officials, and their owne brute inventions. Let them make shewes of reforming while they will, so long as the Church is mounted upon the Prelaticall Cart, and not as it ought betweene the hands of the Ministers, it will but shake and totter, and he that sets to his hand though with a good intent to hinder the shogging of it, in this unlawfull waggonry wherein it rides, let him beware it be not fatall to him as it was to V• a. Certainly if God be the father of his family the Church, wherein could he expresse that name more, then in training it up under his owne all-wise and dear Oeconomy, not turning it loose to the havock of

strangers and wolves that would ask no better plea then this to do• in the Church of Christ, what ever humour, faction, policy, or •
         centious will would prompt them to. Againe, if Christ be the Churches husband expecting her to be presented before him a pure unspotted virgin; in what could he shew his tender love to her mo• then in prescribing his owne wayes which he best knew would be to the improvement of her health and beauty with much great• care doubtlesse then the Persian King could appoint for his Queen• 
         Esther, those maiden dietings & set prescriptions of baths, & odo• which may tender her at last the more amiable to his eye. For o• any age or sex, most unfitly may a virgin be left to an uncertaine and arbitrary education. Yea though she be well instructed, yet is she still under a more strait tuition, especially if betrothed. In like manner the Church bearing the same resemblance, it were not reason to think she should be left destitute of that care which is as necessary, and proper to her, as instruction. For publick preaching indeed is the gift of the spirit working as best seemes to his secret will, but discipline is the practick work o• preaching directed and applied as is most requisite to particular duty; without which it were all one to the benefit of souls, as it would be to the cure of bodi• s, if all the Physitians in London should get into the severall Pulpits of the City, and assembling all the diseased in every pari• should begin a learned Lecture of Pleurisies, Palsies, Lethargies, to which perhaps none there present were inclined, and so without so much as feeling one puls, or giving the least order to any skilfull Apothecary, should dismisse 'em from time to time, some groaning, some languishing, some expiring, with this only charge to look well to themselves, and do as they heare. Of what excellence and necessity then Church-discipline is, how beyond the faculty of man to frame, and how dangerous to be left to mans invention who would be every foot turning it to sinister ends, how properly also it is the worke of God as father, and of Christ as Husband of the Church; we have by thus much heard. "
"5","CHAP. II. That Church governement is set downe in holy scripture, and that to say otherwise is untrue. As therefore it is unsound to say that God hath not appointed any set government in his Church, so is it untrue. Of the time

of the Law there can be no doubt; for to let passe the first institution of Priests and Levites, which is too cleare to be insisted upon, when the Temple came to be built, which in plaine judgement could breed no essentiall change either in religion, or in the Priestly government; yet God to shew how little he could endure that men should be tampring and contriving in his worship, though in things of lesse regard, gave to David for solomon not only a pattern and modell of the Temple, but a direction for the courses of the Priests and Levites, and for all the worke of their service. At the returne from the Captivity things were only restored after the ordinance of Moses and David; or if the least alteration be to be found, they had with them inspired men, Prophets, and it were not sober to say they did ought of moment without divine intimation. In the Prophesie of Ez-kiel from the 40 Chapt. onward, after the destruction of the Temple, God by his Prophet seeking to weane the hearts of the Jewes from their old law to expect a new and more perfect reformation under Christ, sets out before their eyes the stately fabrick & constitution of his Church, with al the ecclesiasticall functions appertaining; indeed the description is as sorted best to the apprehension of those times, typicall and shadowie, but in such manner as never yet came to passe, nor never must literally, unlesse we mean to annihilat the Gospel. But so exquisit and lively the description is in portraying the new state of the Church, and especially in those points where government seemes to be most active, that both Jewes and Gentiles might have good cause to be assured, that God when ever he meant to reforme his Church, never intended to leave the governement thereof delineated here in such curious architecture, to be patch't afterwards, and varnish't over with the devices and imbellishings of mans imagination. Did God take such delight in measuring out the pillars, arches, and doores of a materiall Temple, was he so punctuall and circumspect in lavers, altars, and sacrifices soone after to be abrogated, left any of these should have beene made contrary to his minde? is not a farre more perfect worke more agreeable to his perfection in the most perfect state of the Church militant, the new alliance of God to man? should not he rather now by his owne prescribed discipline have cast his line and levell upon the soule of man which is his rationall temple, and by the divine square and compasse thereof forme and regenerate in us the lovely shapes of vertues and graces, the sooner to edifie and accomplish that immortall stature of Christs body which is his Church, in all her glorious lineaments and proportions. 

And that this indeed God hath done for us in the Gospel 〈◊〉 shall see with open eyes, not under a vaile. We may passe over the history of the Acts and other places, turning only to those Epistle• of s. Paul to Timothy and Titus: where the spirituall eye may discerne more goodly and gracefully erected then all the magnifice• ce of Temple or Tabernacle, such a heavenly structure of evangel• ck discipline so diffusive of knowledge and charity to the prosperous increase and growth of the Church, that it cannot be wondered if that elegant and artfull symmetry of the promised new temple in Ezechiel, and all those sumptuous things under the Law were made to signifie the inward beauty and splendor of the Christian Church thus governed. And whether this be commanded let it now be j• dged. s. Paul after his preface to the first of Timothy which hee concludes in the 17 Verse with Amen, enters upon the subject of his Epistle which is to establish the Church-government with a command. This charge I commit to thee son Timothy: according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them might'st war a good warfare. Which is plain enough thus expounded. This charge I commit to thee wherein I now go about to instruct thee how thou shalt set up Church-discipline, that thou might'st warre a good warfare, bearing thy selfe constantly and faithfully in the Ministery, which in the I to the Corinthians is also called a warfare: and so after a kinde of Parenthesis concerning Hymenaeus he returnes to his command though under the milde word of exhorting, Cap. 2. v. 1. I exhort therefore. As if he had interrupted his former command by the occasionall mention of Hymeneus. More beneath in the 14 V. of the 3 C. when he hath delivered the duties of Bishops or Presbyters and Deacons not once naming any other order in the Church, he thus addes. These things write I unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly (such necessity it seems there was) but if I tarry long, that thou ma• 'st know how thou ought'st to behave thy s• lfe in the house of God. From this place it may be justly ask'• , whether Timothy by this here written might know what was to be knowne concerning the orders of Church-governours or no? If he might, then in such a cleere t• xt as this may we know too without further j• ngle; if he might not, then did s. Paul write insufficiently, and moreover said not true, for he saith here he might know, and I perswade my selfe he did know ere this was written, but that the Apostle had more regard to the instruction of us, then to the informing of him. In the fifth Chap. after some other Church precepts concerning discipline, mark what

a dreadfull command followes, Verse 21. I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect Angels, that thou observe these things, and as if all were not yet sure anough, • e closes up the Epistle, with an adj• ring charge thus. I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, that thou keepe this commandement: that is the whole commandement concerning discipline, being them ine purpose of the Epistle: although Hooker would faine have this denouncement referred to the particular precept going before, because the word Commandement is in the singular number, not remembring that even in the first Chapt. of this Epistle, the wo• Commandement is used in a plurall sense, Vers. 5. Now the end of the Commandement is charity. And what more frequent then in like manner to say the Law of Moses. so that either to restraine the significance too much, or too much to inlarg it would make the adjuration either not so waighty, or not so pertinent. And thus we find here that the rules of Church-discipline are not only commanded, but hedged about with such a terrible impalement of commands, as he that will break through wilfully to violate the least of them, must hazard the wounding of his conscience even to death. Yet all this notwithstanding we shall finde them broken wellnigh all by the faire pretenders even of the next ages. No lesse to the contempt of him whom they fain to be the archfounder of prelaty s. Peter, who by what he writes in the 5 Chap. of his first Epistle should seeme to be farre another man then tradition reports him: there he commits to the Presbyters only full authority both of feeding the flock, and Episcopating: and commands that obedience be given to them as to the mighty hand of God, wch is his mighty ordinance. Yet all this was as nothing to repell the ventrous boldnesse of innovation that ensued, changing the decrees of God that is immutable, as if they had been breathed by man. Neverthelesse when Christ by those visions of s. Iohn foreshewes the reformation of his Church, he bids him take his Reed, and meet it out againe after the first patterne, for he prescribes him no other. Arise, said the Angell, and measure the Temple of God and the Altar, and them that worship therein. What is there in the world can measure men but discipline? Our word ruling imports no lesse. Doctrine indeed is the measure, or at least the reason of the measure, tis true, but unlesse the measure be applied to that which it is to measure, how can it actually doe its proper worke. Whether therefore discipline be all one with doctrine, or the particular application thereof to this or that person,

we all agree that doctrine must be such only as is command• , or whether it be something really differing from doctrine, yet 〈◊〉 it only of Gods appointment, as being the most adequat measure of the Church and her children, which is here the office of a gr• Evangelist and the reed given him from heaven. But that par• of the Temple which is not thus measured, so farre is it from being 〈◊〉 Gods tuition or delight, that in the following verse he rejects i• , however in shew and visibility it may seeme a part of his Church, yet in as much as it lyes thus unmeasured he leaves it to be trampled by the Gentiles, that is to be polluted with idolatrous and Gentilish rites and ceremonies. And th• the principall reformation here foretold is already come to passe as well in discipline as in doctrine the state of our neighbour Churches afford us to behold. Thus through all the periods and changes of the Church it hath beene proved that God hath still reserved to himselfe the right of enacting Church-government. "
"6","CHAP. III. That it is dangerous and unworthy the Gospell to hold that Church-government is to be patterned by the Law, as B. Andrews and the Primat of Armagh maintaine. 
         WE may returne now from this interposing difficulty thus removed, to affi• me, that since Church-government is so strictly commanded in Gods Word, the first and greatest reason why we should submit thereto, is because God hath so commanded. But whether of these two, Prelaty or Presbytery can prove it selfe to be supported by this first and greatest reason, must be the next dispute. Where in this position is to be first layd down as granted; that I may not follow a chase rather then a• argument, that one of these two, and none other is of Gods ordaining, and if it be, that ordinance must be evident in the Gospell. For the imperfect and obscure institution of the Law, which the Apostles themselves doubt not o• t-times to • ilifre, cannot give rules to the compleat and glorious ministration of the Gospell, which lookes on the Law, as on a childe, not as on a tutor. And that the Prelates have no sure foundation in the Gospell, their own guiltinesse doth manifest: they would not else run questing up as high as Adam to fe• h their originall, as tis said one of them lately did in publick. To

which assertion, had I heard it, because I see they are so insatiable of antiquity, I should have gladly assented, and confest them ye• more ancient. For Lucifer before Adam was the fir• prela• Angel, and both he, as is commonly thought, and our 〈◊〉 
         Adam, as we all know, for aspiring above their order• , were miser• bly degraded. But others better advised are content to receive their beginning from Aaron and his sons, among whom B. Andrews of late ye• res, and in these times the Primat of Armagh for their learning are reputed the best able to say what may be said in this opinion. The Primat in his discou• se about the originall of Episcopacy newly revised begins thus. The ground of Episco• cy is fetcht partly from the pattern prescribed by God in the old Testament, and partly from the imitation thereof brought in by the Apostles. Herein I must entreat to be excused of the desire I have to be satisfied, how for example the ground of Episcop. is fetch't partly from the example of the old Testament, by whom next, and by whose authority. secondly, how the Church-government under the Gospell can be rightly called an imitation of that in the old Testament? for that the Gospell is the end and fulfilling of the Law, our liberty also from the bondage of the Law I plainly reade. How then the ripe age of the Gospell should be put to schoole againe, and learn to governe her selfe from the infancy of the Law, the stronger to imitate the weaker, the freeman to follow the captive, the learned to be lessoned by the rude, will be a hard undertaking to evince from any of those principles which either art or inspiration hath written. If any thing done by the Apostles may be drawne howsoever to a likenesse of somethi• g Mosaicall, if it cannot be proved that it was done of purpose in imitation, as having the right thereof grounded in nature, and not in ceremony or type, it will little availe the matter. The whole Judaick law is either politicall, and to take pattern by that, no Christian nation ever thought it selfe o• ged in conscience; or morall, which containes in it the observation of whatsoever is substantially, and perpetually true and good, either in religion, or course of life. That which is thus morall, besides what we f• tch from those unwritten lawes and Ideas which nature hath ingraven in us, the Gospell, as stands with her dignity most, lectures to us from her own authentick hand-writing and command, not copies out from the borrowed manuscript of a subservient scrow• , by way of imitating. As well might she be said in her sacrame• of water to imitate the baptisme of Iohn. What though • he retaine excommunication • sed in the syna • ogue, retain the morality of the

sabbath, she does not therefore imitate the law her underling, but perfect her. All that was morally delivered from the law to the Gospell in the office of the Priests and Levites, was that there should be a ministery set a part to teach and discipline the Church; both which duties the Apostles thought good to commit to the Presbyters. And if any distinction of honour were to be made among them, they directed it should be to those not that only rule well, but especially to those that labour in the word and doctrine. By which we are taught that laborious teaching is the most honourable 1 Tim. 5• 
          Prelaty that one Minister can have above another in the Gospell: if therefore the superiority of Bishopship be grounded on the Priesthood as a part of the morall law, it cannot be said to be an imitation; for it were ridiculous that morality should imitate morality, which ever was the same thing. This very word of patterning or imitating excludes Episcopacy from the solid and grave Ethicall law, and betraies it to be a meere childe of ceremony, or likelier some misbegotten thing, that having pluckt the gay feathers of her obsolet bravery to • ide her own deformed barenesse, now vaunts and glories in her stolne plumes. In the meane while what danger there is against the very life of the Gospell to make in any thing the typical law her pattern, and how impossibl• in that which touches the Priestly government, I shall use such light as I have receaved, to lay open. • t cannot be unknowne by what expressions the holy Apostle s. Paul spar• s not to explane to us the na• ure and condition of the l• calling those o• dinances which were the chiefe and 〈◊〉 offices of the Priests, the elements and rudiments of the world both weake and beggarly. Now to br• ed, and bring up the child• en of the promise, the heirs of liberty and grace under such a kinde of government as is profest to be but an imitation of that ministery which engendered to b• ndage the so• s of Agar, how can this 〈◊〉 but a foul injury and derogation, if not a cancelling of that birth-r• ght and immunity which Christ hath purchased for us with his blood. For the ministration of the law consisting of c• all things, drew to it such a ministery as consisted of ca• all respects, dignity, precedence, and the like. And such a ministery establish't in the Gospell, as is founded upon the points and ter• of superiority, and nests it selfe in worldly honour, will draw to it, and we see it doth, such a religion as • unnes back againe to the old pompe and glory of the flesh. For doubtlesse there is a certaine attraction and magnetick force betwixt the religion and the ministeriall forme thereof. If the religion be pure, spirituall, simple, and

lowly, as the Gospel most truly is, such must the face of the ministery be. And in like manner if the forme of the Ministery be grounded in the worldly degrees of autority, honour, temporall jurisdiction, we see it with our eyes it will turne the inward power and purity of the Gospel into the outward carnality of the law; evaporating and exhaling the internall worship into empty conformities, and gay sh• wes. And what remains then but that wee should runne into as dangerous and deadly apostacy a• our lamented neighbours the Papists, who by this very snire and pitfall of imitating the ceremonial law, fel into that irrecoverable superstition, as must need• make void the cov• nant of salvation to them that persist in this blindnesse. "
"7","CHAP. IV. That it is impossible to make the Priesthood of Aaron a pattern whereon to ground Episcopacy. 
         THat which was promised next, is to declare the impossibility of grounding Evangelick government in the imitation of the Jewish Priesthood: which will be done by considering both the quality of the persons, and the office it selfe. Aaron and his sonnes were the Princes of their Tribe before they were sanctified to the Priesthood: that personall eminence which they held above the other Levites, they receaved not only from their office, but partly brought it into their office: and so from that time forward the Priests were not chosen out of the whole number of the Levites, as our Bishops, but were borne inheritors of the dignity. Therefore unlesse we shall choose our Prelat• only out of the Nobility, and let them runne in a blood, there can be no possible imitation of Lording over their brethren in regard of their persons altogether unlike. As for the office wch was a representation of Christs own person more immediately in the high Priest, & of his whole priestly office in all the other; to the performance of wch the Levits were but as servitors & Deacons, it was necessary there should

be a distinction of dignity betweene two functions of so great od• . But there being no such difference among our Ministers, unlesse it be in reference to the Deacons, it is impossible to found a 〈◊〉 upon the imitation of this Priesthood. For wherein, or in w• worke is the office of a Prelat excellent above that of a Pa• in ordination you'l say; but flatly against scripture, for there we know Timothy receaved ordination by the hands of the Presby• y, notwithstanding all the vaine delusions that are used to 〈◊〉 that testimony, and maintaine an unwarrantable usurpation. But wherefore should ordination be a cause of setting up a superiour degree in the Church• is not that whereby Christ became our saviour a higher and greater worke, then that whereby he did ordai• e messengers to preach and publish him our saviour? Every Minister sustains the person of Christ in his highest work of communicating to us the mysteries of our salvation, and hath the power of binding and absolving, how should he need a higher dignity to represent or execute that which is an inferior work in Christ? why should the performance of ordination which is a lower office exalt a Prelat, and not the seldome discharge of a higher and more noble office 〈◊〉 is preaching & administring much rather depressehim? Verily neither the nature, nor the example of ordinationdoth any way require an imparity betweene the ordainer and the ordained. For what more naturall then every like to produce his like; man to beget man, fire to propagate fire, and in examples of highest opi••
         on the ordainer is inferior to the ordained; fo• the Pope is not ma• e by the precedent Pope, but by Cardinals, who ordain and consecrate to a higher and greater office then their own. "
"8","CHAP. V. To the Arguments of B. Andrews and the Primat. 
         IT followes here to attend to certaine objections in a little treatise lately printed among others of like sort at Oxford, and in the title said to be out of the rude draughts of Bishop Andrews. And surely they bee rude draughts indeed, in so much that it is marvell to think what his friends meant to let come abroad such shallow reasonings with the name of a man so much bruited for learning. In the 12 and 23 pages he seemes most notoriously inconstant to himselfe; for in the former place he tels us he forbeares to take

any argument of Prelaty from Aaron, as being the type of Christ. In the latter he can forbeare no longer, but repents him of his rash gratuity, affirming, that to say, Christ being come in the flesh, his figure in the high Priest ceaseth, is the shift of an Anabaptist; and stiffly argues that Christ being as well King as Priest, was as well fore-resembled by the Kings then, as by the high Priest. so that if his comming take away the one type, it must also the other. Marvellous piece of divinity! and well worth that the land should pay six thousand pound a yeare for, in a Bishoprick, although I reade of no sophister among the Greeks that was so dear, neither Hippias nor Protagoras, nor any whom the socratick schoole famously refuted with out hire. Here we have the type of the King sowed to the typet of the Bishop, suttly to cast a jealousie upon the Crowne, as if the right of Kings; like M• ager in the Metamorphosis, were no longer lived then the firebrand of Prelaty. But more likely the Prelats fearing (for their own guilty carriage protests they doe feare) that their faire dayes cannot long hold, practize by possessing the King with this most false doctrine, to ingage his power for them, as in his owne quarrell, that when they fall they may fall in a generall ruine, just as cruell Tyberius would wish,When I dye, let the earth be rouled in flames. But where, O Bishop, doth the purpose of the law set forth Christ to us as a King? That which never was intended in the Law, can never be abolish'• as part thereof. When the Law was made, there was no King: if before the law, or under the law God by a speciall type in any King would foresignifie the fut• re kingdome of Christ, which is not yet visibly come, what was that to the law? The whole ceremoniall law, and types can be in no law else, comprehends nothing but the propitiatory office of Christs Priesthood, which being in substance accomplisht, both law and Priesthood fades away of it selfe, and passes into aire like a transitory vision, and the right of Kings neither stands by any type nor falls. We acknowledge that the civill magistrate weares an autority of Gods giving, and ought to be obeied as his vicegerent. But to make a King a type, we say is an abusive and unskilfull speech, and of a morall solidity makes it seeme a ceremoniall shadow. Therefore your typical chaine of King and Priest must unlink. But is not the type of Priest taken away by Christs comming? no saith this famous Protestant Bishop of Winchester; it is not, and he that saith it is, is an Anabaptist. What think ye Reade• , do ye not understand him? What can be gathered hence but that the Prelat would still sacrifice?

conceave him readers, he would missifi• ate. Their altar• indeed were in a fair forwardnesse; and by such arguments as th• they were setting up the molten Calfe of their Masseagaine, and of their great Hierarch the Pope. For if the type of Priest be not taken away, then neither of the high Priest, it were a strange behe• ding; and high Priest more then one there cannot be, and that o• e can be no lesse then a Pope. And this doubtlesse was the bent of his career, though never so covertly. Yea but there was something else in the high Priest besides the figure, as is plain by s. Pauls acknowledging him. Tis true that in the 17 of Deut, whence this autority arise• to the Priest in matters too hard for the secular judges, as must needs be many in the occasions of those times involved so with ceremoniall niceties, no wonder though it be commanded to enquire at the mouth of the Priests, who besides the Magistrat• their collegues had the Oracle of Uri• to consult with. And whether the high Priest Ananias had not incroach't beyond the limits of his Priestly autority, or whether used it rightly, was no time then for s. Paul to contest about. But if this instance be able to assert any right of jurisdiction to the Clergy, it must impart it in common to all Ministers, since it were a great folly to seeke for counsell in a hard intricat scruple from a Dunce Prelat, when there might be found a speedier solution from a grave and learned Mi• ister, whom God hath gifted with the judgement of Urim more amply oft-times then all the Prelates together; and now in the Gospell hath granted the privilege of this oraculous Ephod alike to all his Ministers. The reason therefore of imparity in the Priests, being now as is aforesaid, really annulled both in their person, and in their representative office, what right of jurisdiction soever, can be from this place Levitically bequeathed, must descend upon the Ministers of the Gospell equally, as it findes them in all other points equall. Well then he is finally content to let, Aaron go. El• r will serve his turne, as being a superior of superiors, and yet no type of Christ in Aarons life time. O thou that would'st winde into any figment, or phantasme to save thy Miter! Yet all this will not fadge, though it be cunningly interpolisht by some second hand with crooks & emendations; Heare then; the type of Christ in some one particular, as of entring yearly into the Holy of holies and such like, rested upon the High Priest only as more immediately personating our saviour: but to resemble his whole satisfactory office all the lineage of Aaron was no more then sufficient. And all, or any of the Priests considered separately without relation to the

highest, are but as a livelesse trunk and signifie nothing. And this shewes the excellente or Christs sacrifice, who at once and in one person fulfilled that which many hunderds of Priests many times repeating had anough to foreshew. What other imparity there was among themselves, we may safely suppose it depended on the dignity of their birth and family, together with the circumstances of a carnall service, which might afford many priorities. And this I take to be the summe of what the Bishop hath laid together to make plea for P• laty by imitation of the Law. I hough indeed, if it may stand, it will inferre Popedome all as well. Many other courses he tries, enforcing himselfe with much ostentation of endlesse genealogies, as if he were the man that s. Paul forewarnes us of in Timothy, but so unvigorously, that I do not feare his winning of many to his cause, but such as doting upon great names are either over-weake, or over sudden of faith. I shall not refuse therefore to lea• ne so much prudence as I finde in the Roman souldier that attended the crosse, not to stand breaking of legs, when the breath is quite out of the body, but passe to that which follows. The Primat of Armagh at the beginning of his tractat seeks to availe himselfe of that place in the 66 of Esaiah, I will take of them for Priests and Levites, saith the Lord; to uphold hereby such a forme of superiority among the ministers of the Gospell, succeeding those in the law, as the Lords day did the sabbath. But certain if this method may be admitted of interpreting those propheticall passages concerning Christian times in a punctuall correspondence, it may with equall probability be urged upon us, that we are bound to observe some monthly solemnity answerable to the new moons, as well as the Lords day which we keepe in lieu of the sabbath: for in the 23 v. the Prophet joynes them in the same manner together, as before he did the Priests and Levites, thus. And it shall come to passe that from one new moone to another, and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord. Undoubtedly with as good consequence may it be alledged from hence, that we are to solemnize some religious monthly meeting different from the sabbath, as from the other any distinct formality of Ecclesiasticall orders may be inferred. This rather will appeare to be the lawfull and unconstrained sense of the text, that God in taking of them for Priests and Levites, will not esteeme them unworthy though Gentiles, to undergoe any function in the Church, but will make of them a full and perfect ministery, as was that of the Priests

and Levites in their kinde. And Bishop An• rows himselfe to end the controversie, sends us a candid exposition of this quoted verse from the 24 page of his said book, plainly deciding that God by those legall names there of Priests and Levites means our Presbyters, and Deacons, for which either ingenuous confession, or slip of his pen we give him thanks, and withall to him that brought these treatises into one volume, who setting the contradictions of two learned men so neere together, did not foresee. What other deducements or analogies are cited out of s. Paul to pro• e a likenesse betweene the Ministers of the Old and New Testament, having tried their sinewes. I judge they may passe without harme doing to our cause. We may remember then that Prelaty neither hath nor can have foundation in the law, nor yet in the Gospell, which assertion as being for the plainnesse thereof a matter of eye sight, rather then of disquisition I voluntarily omitt, not forgetting to specifie this note againe, that the earnest des• e which the Prelates have to build their Hierarchy upon the sandy bottome of the law, gives us to see abundantly the little assurance which they finde to reare up their high roofs by the autority of the Gospell, repulst as it were from the writings of the Apostles, and driven to take sanctuary among the Jewes. Hence that open confession of the Primat before mentioned. Episcopacy is fetcht partly from the patterne of the Old Testament & partly from the New as an imitation of the Old, though nothing ca• be more rotten in Divinity then such a position as this, and is all one as to say Episcopacy is partly of divine institution, and partly of mans own carving. For who gave the autority to fetch more from the patterne of the law then what the Apostles had already fetcht, if they fetcht any thing at a• l, as hath beene proved they did not. so was Jer• oams Episcopacy partly from the patterne of the law, and partly from the patterne of his owne carnality; a parti-coloured and a parti-membered Episcopacy, and what can this be lesse then a monstrous? Others therefore among the Prelats perhaps not so well able to brook, or rather to justifie this foule relapsing to the old law, have condiscended at last to a plaine confessing that both the names and offices of Bishops and Presbyters at first were the same, and in the scriptures no where distinguisht. This grants the remonstrant in the fift section of his desc• e, and in the Preface to his last short answer. But what need respect he had whether he grant or grant it not, when as through all antiquity, and even in the lo• iest times of Prelaty we finde it granted. 

         Ierome the learned'st of the Fathers hides not his opinion, that custome only, which the Proverbe cals a tyrant, was the maker of Prelaty; before his audacious workman• p the Churches were ruled in common by the Presbyters, and such a certaine truth this was esteemed, that it became a decree among the Papall Canons compiled by Gratian. Ans• lme also of Canturbury, who to uphold the points of his Prelatisme made himselfe a traytor to his country, yet commenting the Epistles to Titus and the Philippians acknowledges from the cleernesse of the text, what Ierome and the Church Rubrick hath before acknowledged. He little dreamt then that the weeding-hook of reformation would after two ages pluck up his glorious poppy from insulting over the good corne. Though since some of our Brittish Prelates seeing themselves prest to produce scripture, try all their cunning, if the New Testament will not help them, to frame of their own heads as it were with wax a kinde of Mimick Bishop limmed out to the life of a dead Priesthood. Or else they would straine us out a certaine figurative Prelat, by wringing the collective allegory of those seven Angels into seven single Rochets. Howsoever since it thus appeares that custome was the creator of Prelaty being lesse ancient then the government of Presbyters, it is an extreme folly to give them the hearing that tell us of Bishops through so many ages: and if against their tedious muster of citations, sees, and successions, it be replied that wagers and Church antiquities, such as are repugnant to the plaine dictat of scripture are both alike the arguments of fooles, they have their answer. We rather are to cite all those ages to an arraignment before the word of God, wherefore, and what pretending, how presuming they durst alter that divine institution of Presbyter• , which the Apostles who were no various and inconstant men surely had set up in the Churches, and why they choose to live by custome and catalogue, or as s. Paul saith by sight and visibility, rather then by faith? But first I conclude from their owne mouthes that Gods command in scripture, which doubtlesse ought to be the first and greatest reason of Church-government, is wanting to Prelaty. And certainly we have plenteous warrant in the doctrine of Christ to determine that the want of this reason is of it selfe sufficient to confute all other pretences that may be brought in favour of it. "
"9","CHAP. VI. That Prelaty was not set up for prevention of schisme, as is pretended, or if it were, that it performes not wh• t it was first set up for, but quite the contrary. YEt because it hath the outside of a specious reason, & specious things we know are aptest to worke with humane lightnesse and frailty, even against the soli• est truth, that sounds not plausibly, let us think it worth the examining for the love of infirmer Christians, of what importance this their second reason may be. Tradition they say hath taught them that for the prevention of growing schisme the Bishop was heaved above the Presbyter. And must tradition then ever thus to the worlds end be the perpetuall cankerworme to eat out Gods Commandements? are his decrees so inconsiderate and so fickle, that when the statutes of solon, or Lycurgus shall prove durably good to many ages, his in 40 yeares shall be found defective, ill contrived, and for needfull causes to be altered? Our saviour and his Apostles did not only foresee, but foretell and forewarne us to looke for schisme. Is it a thing to be imagined of Gods wisdome, or at least of Apostolick prudence to set up such a government in the tendernesse of the Church, as should incline, or not be more able then any other to oppose it selfe to schisme? it was well knowne what a bold lurker schisme was even in the houshold of Christ betweene his owne Disciples and those of Iohn the Baptistabo• fasting: and early in the Acts of the Apostles the noise of schisme had almost drowned the proclaiming of the Gospell; yet we rea• e not in scripture that any thought was had of making Prelates, no not in those places where dissention was most rife. If Prelaty had beene then esteemed a remedy against schisme, where was it more needfull then in that great variance among the Corinthians which s. Paul so laboured to reconcile? and whose eye could have found the fittest remedy sooner then his? and what could have made the remedy more available, then to have used it speedily? and lastly what could have beene more necessary then to have written it for our instruction? yet we see he neither commended it to us, nor used it himselfe. For the same division remaining there, or else bursting

forth againe more then 20 yeares after s. Pauls death, wee finde in Clements Epistle of venerable autority written to the yet factious Corinthians, that they were still governed by Presbyters. And the same of other Churches out of Hermas, and divers other the scholers of the Apostles by the late industry of the learned salmatius appeares. Neither yet did this worthy Clement s. Pauls disciple, though writing to them to lay aside schisme, in the least word advise them to change the Presbyteriall government into Prelaty. And therefore if God afterward gave, or permitted this insurrection of Episcopacy, it is to be feared he did it in his wrath, as he gave the Israelites a King. With so good a will doth he use to alter his own chosen government once established. For marke whether this rare device of mans braine thus prefe• ed before the ordinance of God, had better successe then fleshly wisdome not counseling with God is wont to have. so farre was it from removing schisme, that if schisme parted the congregations before, now it rent and mangled, now it • aged. Heresie begat heresie with a certaine monstrous haste of pregnancy in her birth, at once borne and bringing forth. Contentions before brotherly were now hostile. Men went to choose their Bishop as they went to a pitcht field, and the day of his election was like the sacking of a City, sometimes ended with the blood of thousands. Nor this among hereticks only, but men of the same beliefe, yea confessors, and that with such odious ambition, that Eusebius in his eighth book testifies he abhorred to write. And the reason is not obscure, for the poore dignity or rather burden of a • ochial Presbyter could not ingage any great party, nor that to any deadly feud: but Prelaty was a power of that extent, and sway, that if her election were popular, it was seldome not the cause of some faction or broil in the Church. But if her dignity came by favour of some Prince, she was from that time his creature, and obnoxious to comply with his ends in state were they right or wrong. so that in stead of finding Prelaty an impeacher of schisme or faction, the more I search, the more I grow into all perswasion to think rather that faction and she as with a spousall ring are wedded together, never to be divorc't. But here let every one behold the just, and dreadfull judgement of God meeting with the a• dacious pride of man that durst offer to mend the ordinances of heaven. God out of the strife of men brought forth by his Apostles to the Church that beneficent and ever distributing office of Deacons, the stewards and Ministers of holy almes,

man out of the pretended care of peace & unity being caught in the snare of his impious boldnesse to correct the will of Christ, brought forth to himselfe upon the Church that irreconcileable schisme of perdition and Apostasy, the Roman Antichrist: for that the exaltation of the Pope arose out of the reason of Prelaty it cannot be denied. And as I noted before that the patterne of the High Priest pleaded for in the Gospel (for take away the head Priest the rest are but a carcasse) sets up with better reason a Pope, then an Archbishop, for if Prelaty must still rise and rise till it come to a Primat, why should it stay there? when as the catholick government is not to follow the division of kingdomes, the temple best representing the universall Church, and the High Priest the universall head; so I observe here, that if to quiet schisme there must be one head of Prelaty in a land or Monarchy rising from a Provinciall to a nationall Primacy, there may upon better grounds of repressing schisme be set up one catholick head over the catholick Church. For the peace and good of the Church is not terminated in the schismelesse estate of one or two kingdomes, but should be provided for by the joynt consultation of all reformed Christendome: that all controversie may end in the finall pronounce or canon of one Arch-primat, or P• otestant Pope. Although by this meanes for ought I see, all the diameters of schisme may as well meet and be knit up in the center of one grand falshood. Now let all impartiall men arbitrate what goodly inference these two maine reasons of the Prelats have, that by a naturall league of consequence make more for the Pope then for themsel• . Yea to say more home are the very wombe for a new subantichrist to breed in; if it be not rather the old force and power of the same man of sin counterfeiting protestant. It was not the prevention of schisme, but it was schisme it selfe, and the hatefull thirst of Lording in the Church that first bestowed a being upon P• elaty; this was the true cause, but the pretence is stil the same. The Prelates, as they would have it thought, are the only mawls of schisme. Forsooth if they be put downe, a deluge of innumerable sects will follow; we shall be all Brownists, Familists Anabaptists. For the word P• ritan seemes to be quasht, and all that heretofore were counted such, are now Brownists. And thus doe they raise an evill report upon the expected reforming grace that God hath bi• us hope for, like those faithlesse spie• , whose carcasses shall perish in the wildernesse of their owne confused ignorance, and never taste the good of reformation. Doe they

keep away schisme? if to bring a num and chil stupidity of soul, an unactive blindnesse of minde upon the people by thei• leaden doctrine, or no doctrine at all, if to persecure all knowing and zealous Christians by the violence of their courts, be to keep away schisme, they keep away schisme indeed; and by this kind of discipline all Italy and spaine is as p• ely and politickly kept from schisme as England hath beene by them. With as good a plea might the dead pal• boast to a man, ti• I that free you from stitches and paines, and the troublesome feeling of cold & heat, of wounds and strokes; if I were gone, all these would molest you. The Winter might as well vaunt it selfe against the spring, I destroy all noysome and rank weeds, I keepe downe all pestilent vapours. Yes and all wholesome herbs, and all fresh dews, by your violent & hid • bound frost; but when the gentle west winds shall open the fruitfull bosome of the earth thus over-gird• d by your imprisonment, then the flowers put forth and spring and then the s• ne shall scatter the mists, and the ma• ing hand of the Tiller shall roo• up all that burdens the soile without thank to your bondage. But farre worse then any frozen captivity is the bondage of P• elates, for that other, if it keep down any thing which is good, within the earth, so doth it likewise that which is ill, but these let out freely the ill, and keep down the good, or else keepe downe the less• r ill, and let out the greatest. Be ashamed at last to tell the parliament ye curbe schismaticks, when as they know ye cherish and side with Papists, and are now as it were one party with them, and tis said they helpe to petition for ye. Can we believe that your government strains in good earnest at the petty g• ats of schisme, when as we see it makes nothing to swallow the Camel heresie of Rome; but that indeed your throat• are of the righ• Pharisaical straine. Where are those schismaticks with whom the Prelats hold such hot skirmish? shew us your acts, those glorious annals which your Courts of loathed memory lately deceased have left us? those schismaticks I doubt me wil be found the most of them such a• whose only schisme was to have spoke the truth against your high abominations and cruelties in the Church; this is the schisme ye hate most, the removall of your criminous Hierarchy. A politick government of yours, and of a pleasant conceit, set up to remove those as a pretended schisme, that would remove you as a palpable heresie in government. If the schisme would pardon ye that, she might go jagged in as many cuts and • lashes as she pleased for you. As for the rending of the Church, we have many

reasons to thinke it is not that which ye labour to prevent so much as the rending of your pontificall sleeves: that schisme would be the sorest schisme to you, that would be Brownisme and An•
         baptisme indeed. If we go downe, say you, as if Adrians wall were broke, a flood of sects will rush in. What sects? What are their opinions? give us the Inventory; it will appeare both by your former prosecutions and your present instances, that they are only such to speake of as are offended with your lawlesse government, your ceremonies, your Liturgy, an extract of the Masse book transl• ted. But that they should be contemners of publick prayer, and Churches used without superstition, I trust God will manifest it ere long to be as false a sl• nder, as your former slanders against the scots. Noise it till ye be hoarse; that a rabble of sects will come in, it will be answered ye, no rabble sir Priest, but a unanimous multitude of good Protestants will then joyne to the Church, which now because of you stand separated. This will be the dreadfull consequence of your removall. As for those terrible names of sectaries and schismaticks which ye have got together, we know your manner of fight, when the quiver of your arguments which it ever thin, and weakly stored, after the first brunt is quite empty, your course is to be take ye to your other quiver of slander, wherein lyes your best archery. And whom ye could not move by sophisticall arguing, them you thinke to confute by scandalous misnaming. Thereby inciting the blinder sort of people to mislike and deride sound doctrine and good christianity under two or three vile • nd hatefull terms. But if we could easily indure and dissolve your doubtiest reasons in argument, we shall more easily beare the w• rst of your unreasonablenesse in calumny and false report. Especially being foretold by Christ, that if he our Master were by your predecessors cal• ed samaritan and Belzebub, we must not think it strange if his best Disciples in the reformation, as at first by those of your tribe they were called Lollards and Hussites, so now by you be termed Puritans, and Brownists. But my hope is that the people of England will not suffer themselves to be juggled thus out of their faith and religion by a mist of names cast before their eyes, but will search wisely by the scriptures, and look quite through this fraudulent aspersion of a disgracefull name into the things themselves: knowing that the Primitive Christians in their times were accounted such as are now called Familists and Adamites, or worse. And many on the Prelatickside like the Church of sardis have a name

to live, and yet are dead; to be Protestants, and are indeed Papists in most of their principles. Thu• perswaded, this your old fallacy wee shall soone unmask, and quickly apprehend how you prevent schisme, and who are your schismatick• . But what if ye prevent, and hinder all good means of preventing schisme? that way which the Apostles used, was to call a councell; from which by any thing that can be learnt from the fifteenth of the Acts, no faithfull Christian was debarred, to whom knowledge and piety might give entrance. Of such a councell as this every parochiall Consistory is a right homogeneous and constituting part being in it selfe as it were a little synod, and towards a generall assembly moving upon her own basis in an even and firme progression, as those smaller squares in battell unite in one great cube, the main phalanx, an embleme of truth and stedfastnesse. Whereas on the other side Prelaty ascending by a graduall monarchy from Bishop to Arch-bishop, from thence to P imat, and from thence, for there can be no reason yeilded neither in nature, nor in religion, wherefore, if it have lawfully mounted thus high, it should not be a Lordly ascendent in the horoscope of the Church, from Primate to Patriarch, and so to Pope. I say Prelaty thus ascending in a continuall pyramid upon pretence to perfect the Churches unity, if notwithstanding it be found most needfull, yea the utmost helpe to dearn up the rents of schisme by calling a councell, what does it but teach us that Prelaty is of no force to effect this work which she boasts to be her maister-peice; and that her pyramid aspires and sharpens to ambition, not to • erfection, or unity. This we know, that as often as any great schisme disparts the Church, and synods be proclamed, the Presbyters • ve as great right there, and as free vote of old, as the Bishops, which the Canon law conceals not. so that Prelaty if she will seek to close up divisions in the Church, must be forc't to dissolve, and unmake her own pyramidal figure, which she affi• mes to be of such • niting power, when as indeed it is the most dividing, and schism• icall forme that Geometricians know of, and must be faine to inglobe, or incube her selfe among the Presbyters; which she hating to do, sends her haughty Prelates from all parts with their fork• d Miters, the badge of schisme or the stampe of his clov• n foot whom they serve I think, who according to their hierarchies ac• nating still higher and higher in a cone of Prelaty, in stead of healing up the gas• es of the Church, as it happens in such pointed bodies m• eting, fall to gore on• another with their sharpe

spires for upper place, and precedence, till the councell it 〈◊〉 prove the greatest schisme of all. And thus they are so farre fro• hindring dissention, that they have made unprofitable, and eve• noysome the chiefest remedy we have to keep Christendom at one, which is by councels: and these if wee rightly consider Apostolick example, are nothing else but generall Presbyteries. This seemed so farre from the Apostles to think much of, as if hereby their dignity were impaired, that, as we may gather by those Epistles of Peter and Iohn, which are likely to be latest written, when the Church grew to a setling, like those heroick patricians of Rome (if we may use such comparison) hasting to lay downe their dictatorship, they rejoys't to call themselves and to be as fellow Elders among their brethren. Knowing that their high office was but as the scaffolding of the Church yet unbuilt, and would be but a troublesome disfigurement, so soone as the building was finis• . But the losty minds of an age or two after, such was their small discerning, thought it a poore indignity, that the high reared government of the Church should so on a sudden, as it seemed to them, squat into a Presbytery. Next or rather before councels the timeliest prevention of schisme is to preach the Gospell abundantly and powerfully throughout all the land, to instruct the youth religiously, to endeavour how the scriptures may be easiest understood by all men; to all which the proceedings of these men have been on set purpose contrary. But how O Prelats should you remove schisme, and how should you not remove and oppose all the meanes of removing schism? when Prelaty is a schisme it selfe from the most reformed and most flourishing of our neighbour Churches abroad, and a sad subject of discord and offence to the whole nation 〈◊〉 home. The remedy which you alledge is the very disease we groan under; and never can be to us a remedy but by removing it selfe. Your predecessors were believed to assume this preeminence above their brethren only that they might appease dissention. Now God and the Church cals upon you, for the same reason to lay it down, as being to thousands of good men offensive, burdensome, intolerable. surrender that pledge which unlesse you sowlely us• rpt it, the Church gave you, and now claimes it againe, for the reason she first lent it. Discharge the trust committed to you prevent schisme, and that yeoan never do, but by discha• ging your selves. That government which ye hold, we con• esse pr• s much, hinders much 〈◊〉 move• much, but what th• 
         〈◊◊◊〉 of the Church? — no,

but all the peace and unity, all the welfare not of the Church alone, but of the whole kingdome. And if it be still permitted ye to hold, will cause the most sad I know not whether separation be anough to say, but such a wide gulph of distraction in this land as will never close her dismall gap, untill ye be forc't (for of your selv• ye wil never do as that Roman Curtius nobly did) for the Churches peace & your countries, to leap into the midst, and be no more seen. By this we shal know whether yours be that ancient Prelaty which you say was first constituted for the reducement of quiet & unanimity into the Church, for thē you wil not delay • o prefer that above your own preferment. If otherwise, we must be confident that your Prelaty is nothing else but your ambition, an insole• t preferring of your selves above your brethren, and all your learned scraping in antiquity even to disturbe the bones of old Aaron and his sonnes in their graves, is but to maintain and set upon our necks a stately and severe dignity, which you call sacred, and is nothing in very deed but a grave and reverent gluttony, a sanctimonious avarice, in comparison of which, all the duties and dearnesses which ye owe to God or to his Church, to law, custome, or nature, ye have resolved to set at nought. I could put you in mind what counsell Clement a fellow labourer with the Apostles gave to the Presbyters of Corinth, whom the people though unjustly sought to remove. Who among you saith he, is noble minded, who is pittifull, who is charitable, let him say thus, if for me this sedition, this enmity, these differences be, I willingly depart, I go my wayes, only let the flock of Christ be at peace with the Presbyters that are set over it. He that shall do this, saith he, shall get him great honour in the Lord, and all places will receave him. This was Clements counsell to good and holy men that they should depart rather from their just office, then by their stay, to ravle out the seamlesse garment of concord in the Church. But I have better counsell to give the Prelats, and farre more acceptable to their cares, this advice in my opinion is fitter for them. Cling fast to your Pontificall sees, bate not, quit your selves like Barons, stand to the utmost for your haughty Courts and votes in Parliament. still tell us that you prevent schisme, though schisme and combustion be the very issue of your bodies your first born; and set your country a bleeding in a Prelaticall mutiny, to fight for your pompe, and that ill favoured weed of temporall honour that sits dishonourably upon your laick shoulders, that ye may be fat and fleshy, swo• with high thoughts

and big with mischievous designes, when God comes to visit 〈◊〉 you all this forescore yeares vexation of his Church under your Egyptian tyranny. For certainly of all those blessed soules which you have persecuted, and those miserable ones which you have lost; the just vengeance does not sleepe. "
"10","CHAP. VII. That those many sects and schismes by some supposed to be among us, and that rebellion in Ireland, oug• t not to be a hindrancc, but a hastning of reformation. 
         As for those many sects and divisions rumored abroad to be amongst us, it is not hard to perceave that they are partly the meere fictions and false alarmes of the Prelates, thereby to cast amazements and panick terrors into the hearts of weaker Christians that they should not venture to change the present deformity of the Church for fear of I know not what worse inconveniencies. With the same objected feares and suspicions, we know that suttle Prelat Gardner sought to divert the first reformation. It may suffice us to be taught by s. Paul that there must be f• cts for the manifesting of those that are sound hearted. These are but winds and flaws to try the floting vessell of our faith whether it be stanch and sayl well, whether our ballast be just, our anchorage and cable strong. By this is seene who lives by faith and certain knowledge, and who by credulity and the prevailing opinion of the age; whose vertue is of an unchangeable graine, and whose of a slight wash. If God come to trie our constancy we ought not to shrink, or stand the lesse firmly for that, but passe on with more stedfast resolution to establish the truth though it were through a lane of sects and heresies o• each side. Other things men do to the glory of God: but sects and errors it seems God suffers to be for the glory of good men, that the world may know and reverence their true fortitude and undaunted constancy in the truth. Let • s not therefore make these things an incumbrance, or an excuse of our delay in reforming which God sends us as an incitement to proceed with more honour and alacrity. For if there were no opposition where were the triall of an unfai• d goodnesse and magnanimity? vertue that wavers is 〈◊〉 vertue,

but vice revolted from i• selfe, and after a while returning. Th• actions of just and pious men do not darken in their middle course but solomon tels us they are as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfet day. But if we shall suffer the trifling doubts and jealousies of future sects to overcloud the faire beginnings of purpos'st reformation, let us rather fear that another proverb of the same Wiseman be not up• ided to us, that the way of the wicked is as darknesse, they stumble at they know not what. If sects and schismes be turbulent in the unse• led estate of a Church, while it lies under the amending hand, it best beseems our Christian courage to think they are but as the throws and pangs that go before the birth of reformation, and that the work it selfe is now in doing. For if we look but on the nature of elementall and mixt things, we know they cannot suffer any change of one kind o• quality into another without the struggl of contrarietie• . And in thing• artificiall, seldome any elegance is wrought without a superfluous wast and refuse in the transaction. No Marble statue can be po• itely carved, no fair edifice built without almost as much • bbish and sweeping. Insomuch that even in the spirituall conflict of s. Pauls conversion there fell scales from his eyes that were not perceaved before. No wonder then in the reforming of a Church which is never brought to effect without the fierce encounter of truth and fashood together, if, as it were the splinters and shares of so violent a jousting, there fall from between the shock many fond errors and fanatick opinions, which when truth has the upper hand, and the reformation shall be perfet• d, will easily be rid out of the way, or kept so low, as that they shall be only the exercise of our knowledge, not the disturbance, or interruption of our faith. As for that which Barcl• y in his image of minds writes concerning the horrible and barbarous conceits of Englishmen in their religion. I deeme it spoken like what hee was, a fugitive Papist traducing the Hand whence he sprung. It may be more judiciously gathered from hence, that the Englishman of many other nations is least atheisticall, and bears a naturall disposition of much reverence and awe towards the Deity; but in hi• weaknesse and want of better instruction, which among us too f•
         quently is neglected, especially by the meaner sort turning the b• nt of his own wits with a scrupulous and ceaselesse care what he might do to informe himselfe a right of God and his worship, he may fall not unlikely sometimes as any otherland man into an uncouth

opinion. And verily if we look • t his native towardli• sse i• the roughcast without breeding, some nation or other may haply be better composed to a naturall civility, and right judgement the• he. But if he get the benefit once of a wise and well rectified •
         ture, which must first come in generall from the godly vigilance of the Church, I suppose that where ever mention is made of countries manners, or men, the English people among the first that shall be praised, may deserve to be accounted a right pious, right honest, and right hardy nation. But thus while some stand dallying and deferring to reform for fear of that which should mainly hasten them forward, lest schism and error should encrease, we may now thank our selves and our delayes if instead of schism a bloody and inhumane rebellion be strook in between our slow movings. Indeed against violent and powerfull opposition there can be no just blame of a lingring dispatch. But this I urge against those that discourse it for a maxim, as if the swift opportunities of establishing, or reforming religion, were to attend upon the • eam of state businesse. In state many things at first are crude and hard to digest, which only time and deliberation can supple, and concoct. But in religion wherein i• no immaturity, nothing out of season, it goes farre otherwise. The doore of grace turnes upon smooth hinges wide opening to send out, but soon shutting to recall the precious offers of mercy to a nation: which unlesse Watchfulnesse and Zeale two quick-sighted and ready-handed Virgins be there in our behalfe to receave, we loose: and still the of• er we loose, the straiter the doore opens, and the lesse is offered. This is all we get by demurring in Gods service. Tis not rebellion that ought to be the hindrance of reformation, but it is the want of this which is the cause of that. The Prelats which boast themselves the only bridle• of schisme God knows have been so cold and backward both there and with us to represse heresie and idolatry, that either through their carelessenesse or their craft all this mischiefe is befal• . What can the Irish subject do lesse in Gods just displeasure against us, then revenge upon English bodies the little care that our Prelate have had of their souls. Nor hath their negligence been new in that Iland but ever notorious in Queen Elizabeths dayes, as Camden their known friend forbears not to complain. Yet so little are they touch• with remorce of these their cruelties, for these cruelties are theirs, the bloody revenge of those souls which they have fami• ht, that wh• s against our brethren the scot• , who by their upright and loyall

and loyall deed• have now bought themselves a• honourable name to posterity, whatsoever malice by slander could invent, rag• i• hostility attempt, they greedily attempted, toward these murd• ous Irish the enemies of God and mankind, a cursed off-spring of their own connivence, no man takes notice but that they seeme to be very calmely and indifferently affected. Where then should we begin to extinguish a rebellion that hath his cause from the misgovernment of the Church, where? but at the Churches reformation, and the removall of that government which pe• sues and war• es with all good Christians under the name of schismaticks, but maintains and fosters all Papists and Idolaters 〈◊〉 tolerable Christians. And if the sacred Bible may be our light, we are neither without example, nor the witnesse of God himselfe, that the corrupted estate of the Church is both the cause of tumult, and civill warres, and that to stint them, the peace of the Church must first be s• led. Now for a long season, saith Azariah to King Asa, Israel hath 〈◊〉 without the true God, and without a teaching Priest, and without, law; and in those times there was no peace to him that went out, • or to hi• that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabit• nts of the countries. And nation was destroied of nation, and City of City, f• God did vex them with all adversity. Be ye strong therefore, saith he to the reformers of that age, and let not your hands be weake, for your worke shall bee rewarded. And in those Prophets that lived in the times of reformation after the Captivity often doth God stirre up the people to consider that while establishment of Church matters was neglected, and put off, there was no peace to him that went out or came in, for I, saith God, had set all men every one against his neigbour. 
         Zechar. 8. But from the very day forward that they went seriously, and effectually about the welfare of the Church, he tels them that they Haggai 2. themselves might perceave the sudden change of things into a prosperous and peacefull condition. But it will here be said that the reformation is a long work, and the miseries of Ireland are urgent of a speedy redresse. They be indeed; and how speedy we are, the poore afflicted remnant of our martyred countrymen that sit there on the sea-shore, counting the houres of our delay with their sighs, and the minuts with their falling teares, perhaps with the destilling of their bloody wounds, if they have not quite by this time cast off, and almost curst the vain hope of our foundered ships, and aids, can best judge how speedy we are to their reliefe. But let their succors be hasted, as all need and reason is, and let not therefore the reformation

which is the chiefest cause of successe and victory be still procrastinated. They of the captivity in their greatest extremities could find both counsell and hands anough at once to build, and to expect the enemies assault. And we for our parts a populous and mighty nation must needs be faln into a strange plight either of effeminacy, or confusion, if Ireland that was once the conquest of one single Earle with his privat forces, and the small assistance of a petty Kernish Prince, should now take up all the wisdome and prowesse of this potent Monarchy to quell a barbarous crew of r• bels, whom if we take but the right course to subdue, that is beginning at the reformation of our Church, their own horrid murders and rapes, will so fight against them, that the very sutler• and horse boyes of the Campe will be able to rout and chase them without the staining of any Noble sword. To proceed by other method in this enterprize, be our Captains and Commanders never so expert, will be as great an error in the art o• warre, as any novice in souldiership ever committed. And thus I leave it as a declared truth, that neither the feare of sects no nor rebellion can be a fit plea to stay reformation, but rather to push it forward with all possible diligence and speed. "
"11","The second Book. HOw happy were it for this frail, and as it may be truly called, mortall life of man, since all earthly things which have the name of good and convenient in our daily use, are withall so cumbersome and full of trouble if knowledge yet which is the best and, lightsomest possession of the mind, were as the common saying is, no burden, and that what it wanted of being a load to any part of the body, it did not with a heavie advantage overlay upon the spirit. For not to speak of that knowledge that rests in the contemplation of naturall causes and dimensions, which must needs be a lower wisdom, as the object is low, certain it is that he who hath obtained in more then the scantest measure to know any thing distinctly of God, and of his true worship, and what is infallibly good and happy in the state of mans life, what in it selfe evil and miserable, though vulgarly not so esteemed, he that hath obtained to know this, the only high valuable wisdom indeed, remembring also that God even to a strictnesse requires the improvment of these his entrusted gifts cannot but sustain a sore• burden of mind, and more pressing then any supportable toil, or waight, which the body can labour under; how and in what manner he shall dispose and employ those summes of knowledge and illumination, which God hath sent him into this world to trade with. And that which aggravats the burden more is, that having received amongst his allotted parcels certain pretious truths of such an orient lustre as no Diamond can equall, which never the lesse he has in charge to put off at any cheap rate, yea for nothing to them that will, the great Marchants of this world searing that this cours would soon discover, and disgrace the fals glitter of their deceitfull wares wherewith they abuse the people, like poor Indians with beads and glasses,

practize by all means how they may suppresse the venting of such rarities and such a cheapnes as would undoe them, and turn their trash upon their hands. Therefore by gratifying the corrupt desi• of men in fleshly doctrines, they stirre them up to persecute with hatred and contempt all those that seek to bear themselves uprightly in this their spiritual factory: which they forseeing though they cannot but testify of Tr• th and the excellence of t• at heavenly traffick which they bring against what opposition, or danger soever, yet needs must it sit heavily upon their spirits, that being in Gods prime intention and their own, selected heralds of peace, and dispensers of treasures inestimable without price to them that have no pence, they finde in the discharge of their commission that they are made the greatest variance and offence, a very sword and fire both in house and City over the whole earth. This is that which the sad Prophet Ieremiah laments, Wo is me my mother, that thou hast born me a man of strife, and contention. And although divine inspiration must certainly have been sweet to those ancient profets, yet the irksomnesse of that truth which they brought was so unpleasant to them, that every where they call it a burden. Yea that mysterious book of Revelation which the great Evangelist was bid to eat, as it had been some eye-brightning electuary of knowledge, and foresight, though it were sweet in his mouth, and in the learning, it was bitter in his belly; bitter in the denouncing. Nor was this hid from the wise Poet sophocles, who in that place of his Tragedy where Tirefias is called to resolve K. Edipus in a matter which he knew would be grievous, brings him in bemoaning his lot, that he knew more then other men. For surely to every good and peaceable man it must in nature needs be a hatefull thing to be the displeaser, and molester of thousands; much better would it like him doubtlesse to be the messenger of gladnes and contentment, which is his chief intended busines, to all mankind, but that they resist and oppose their own true happinesse. But when God commands to take the trumpet and blow a dolorous or a jarring blast, it lies not in mans will what he shall say, or what he shall conceal. If he shall think to be silent, as Ieremiah did, because of the reproach and derision he met with daily, and all his familiar friends watcht for his halting to be revenged on him for speaking the truth, he would be forc'• to confesse as he confest, his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, I was weary with forbearing, and could not stay. Which might teach these times not suddenly to condemn all

things that are sharply spoken, or vehemently written, as proceeding out of stomach, virulence and ill nature, but to consider rather that if the Prelats have leav to say the worst that can be said, and doe the worst that can be don, while they strive to keep to themselves to their great pleasure and commodity those things which they ought to render up, no man can be justly offended with him that shall endeavour to impart and bestow without any gain to himselfe those sharp, but saving words which would be a terror, and a torment in him to keep back. For me I have determined to lay up as the best treasure, and solace of a good old age, if God voutsafe it me, the honest liberty of free speech from my youth, where I shall think it available in so dear a concernment as the Churches good. For if I be either by disposition, or what other cause too inquisitive, or suspitious of my self and mine own doings, who can help it? but this I foresee, that should the Church be brought under heavy oppression, and God have given me ability the while to reason against that man that should be the author of so foul a deed, or should she by blessing from above on the industry and courage of faithfull men change this her distracted estate into better daies without the lest furtherance or contribution of those few talents which God at that present had lent me, I foresee what stories I should heare within my selfe, all my life after, of discourage and reproach. Timorous and ingratefull, the Church of God is now again at the foot of her insulting enemies: and thou bewailst, what matters it for thee or thy bewailing? when time was, thou couldst not find a syllable of all that thou hadst read, or studied, to utter in her behalfe. Yet ease and leasure was given thee for thy retired thoughts out of the sweat of other men. Thou hadst the diligence the parts, the language of a man, if a vain subject were to be adorned or beautified, but when the cause of God and his Church was to be pleaded, for which purpose that tongue was given thee which thou hast, God listened if he could heare thy voice among his zealous servants, but thou wert domb as a beast; from hence forward be that which thine own brutish silence hath made thee. Or else I should have heard on the other care, slothfull, and ever to be set light by, the Church hath now overcom her late distresses after the unwearied labours of many her true servants that stood up in her defence; thou also wouldst take upon thee to share amongst them of their joy: but wherefore tho• where canst thou shew any word or deed of thine which might have ha• tened her peace; whatever

thou dost now talke; or write, or look is the almes of other me• active prudence and zeale. Dare not now to say, or doe any thing better then thy former sloth and infancy, or if thou darst, thou dost impudently to make a thrifty purchase of boldnesse to thy selfe out of the painfull merits of other men: what before was thy sin, is now thy duty to be, abject, and worthlesse. These and such like lessons as these, I know would have been my Matins duly, • nd my Even-song. But now by this litle diligence, mark what a privilege I have gained; with good men and saints to clame my right of lamenting the tribulations of the Church, if she should suffer, when others that have ventured nothing for her sake, have not the honour to be admitted mourners. But if she lift up her drooping head and prosper, among those that have something more then wisht her welfare, I have my charter and freehold of rejoycing to me and my heires. Concerning therefore this way ward subject against prelaty, the touching whereof is so distastfull and disquietous to a number of men, as by what hath been said I may deserve of charitable readers to be credited, that neither envy nor gall hath ente• d me upon this controversy, but the enforcement of conscience only, and a preventive fear least the omitting of this duty should be against me when I would store up to my self the good provision of peacefull hours, so lest it should be still imputed to me, as I have found i• hath bin, that some self-pleasing humor of vain-glory hath incited me to contest with men of high estimation now while green yeer• are upon my head, from this needlesse sor• isall I shall hope to disswade the intelligent and equal auditor, if I can but say succesfully that which in this exigent behoovs me, although I would be heard only, if it might be, by the elegant & learned reader, to whom principally for a while I shal beg leav I may addresse my selfe. To him it will be no new thing though I tell him that if I hunted after praise by the ostentation of wit and learning, I should not write thus out of mine own season, when I have neither yet compleated to my minde the full circle of my private studies, although I complain not of any insufficiency to the matter in hand, or were I ready to my wishes, it were a folly to cōmit any thing elaborately composed to the carelesse and interrupted listening of these tumultuous timer. Next if I were wise only to mine own ends, I would certainly take such a subject as of it self might catch applause, whereas this hath all the disadvantages on the contrary, and such a subject as the publishing whereof might be delayd at pleasure, and time enough to

pencill it over with all the curious touches of art, even to the perfection of a faultlesse picture, whenas in this argument the not deferring is of great moment to the good speeding, that if solidity have leisure to doe her office, art cannot have much. Lastly, I should not chuse this manner of writing wherin knowing my self inferior to my self, led by the genial power of nature to another task, I have the use, as I may account it, but of my left hand. And though I shall be foolish in saying more to this purpose, yet since it will be such a folly as wisest men going about to commit, have only confest and so committed, I may trust with more reason, because with more folly to have courteous pardon. For although a Poet soaring in the high region of his fancies with his garland and singing robes about him might without apology speak more of himself then I mean to do, yet for me sitting here below in the cool element of prose, a mortall thing among many readers of no Empyreall conceit, to venture and divulge unusual things of my selfe, I shall petition to the gentler sort, it may not be envy to me. I must say therefore that after I had from my first yeeres by the ceaselesse diligence and care of my father, whom God recompence, bin exercised to the tongues, and some sciences, as my age would suffer, by sundry masters and teachers both at home and at the schools, it was found that whether ought was imposed me by them that had the overlooking, or betak'n to of mine own choise in English, or other tongue prosing or versing, but chiefly this latter, the stile by certain vital fignes it had, was likely to live. But much latelier in the privat Academies of Italy, whither I was favored to resort, perceiving that some trifles which I had in memory, composed at under twenty or thereabout (for the manner is that every one must give some proof of his wit and reading there) met with acceptance above what was lookt for, and other things which I had shifted in scarsity of books and conveniences to patch up amongst them, were received with written Encomiums, which the Italian is not forward to bestow on men of this side the Alps, I began thus farre to assent both to them and divers of my friends here at home, and not lesse to an inward prompting which now grew daily upon me, that by labour and intent study (which I take to be my portion in this life) joyned with the strong propensity of nature, I might perhaps leave something so written to aftertimes, as they should not willingly let it die. These thoughts at once possest me, and these other. That if I were certain to write as men buy Leases, for three lives and downward,

there ought no regard be sooner had, then to Gods glory by the honour and instruction of my country. For which cause, and not only for that I knew it would be hard to arrive at the second rank among the Latines, I applied my selfe to that resolution which Aristo followed against the perswasions of Bembo, to fix all the industry and art I could unite to the adorning of my native tongue; not to make verbal curiosities the end, that were a toylsom vanity, but to be an interpreter & relater of the best and sagest things among mine own Citizens throughout this Iland in the mother dialect. That what the greatest and choycest wits of Athens, Rome, or modern Italy, and those Hebrews of old did for their country, I in my proportion with this over and above of being a Christian, might doe for mine: not caring to be once named abroad, though perhaps I could attaine to that, but content with these British Ilands as my world, whose fortune hath hitherto bin, that if the Athenians, 〈◊〉 some say, made their small deeds great and renowned by their eloquent writers, England hath had her noble atchievments made small by the unskilfull handling of monks and mechanick• . Time serv• not now, and perhaps I might seem too profuse to give any certain account of what the mind at home in the spacious circuits of her musing hath liberty to propose to her self, though of highest hope, and hardest attempting, whether that Epick form whereof the two poems of Homer, and those other two of Virgil and Tasso are a diffuse, and the book of Iob a brief model• or whether the rules of Aristotle herein are strictly to be kept, or nature to be followed, which in them that know art, and use judgement is no transgression, but an inriching of art. And lastly what K or Knight before the conquest might be chosen in whom to lay the pattern of a Christian Heroe. And as Tasso gave to a Prince of Italy his chois whether he would command him to write of Godfreys expedition against the infidels, or Belisarius against the Gothes, or Charlemain against the Lombards; if to the instinct of nature and the imboldning of art ought may be trusted, and that there be nothing advers in our climat, or the fate of this age, it haply would be no rashnesse from an equal diligence and inclination to present the like offer in our own ancient stories. Or whether those Dramatick constitutions, wherein sophocles and Euripides raigne shall be found more doctrinal and exemplary to a Nation, the scripture also affords us a divine pastoral Drama in the song of salomon consisting of two persons and a double Chorus, as Origen rightly judges. 

And the Apocalyps of saint Iohn is the majestick image of a high and stately Tragedy, shutting up and intermingling her solemn scenes and Acts with a sevenfold Chorus of halleluja's and harping symphonies: and this my opinion the grave autority of Pare• 
          commenting that booke is sufficient to confirm. Or if occasion shall lead to imitat those magnifick Odes and Hymns wherein Pin•
           darus and Callimachus are in most things worthy, some others in their frame judicious, in their matter most an end faulty: But those frequent songs throughout the law and prophets beyond all these, not in their divine argument alone, but in the very critical art of composition may be easily made appear over all the kinds of Lyrick poesy, to be incomparable. These abilities, wheresoever they be found, are the inspired guift of Go• rarely bestowed, but yet to some (though most abuse) in every Nation: and are of power beside the office of a pulpit, to inbreed and cherish in a great people the seeds of vertu, and publick civility, to allay the perturbations of the mind, and set the affections in right tune, to celebrate in glorious and lofty Hymns the throne and equipage of Gods Almightinesse, and what he works, and what he suffers to be wrought with high providence in his Church, to sing the victorious agonies of Martyrs and saints, the deeds and triumphs of just and pious Nations doing valiantly through faith against the enemies of Christ, to deplore the general relapses of Kingdoms and states from justice and Gods true worship. Lastly, whatsoever in religion is holy and sublime, in vertu amiable, or grave, whatsoever hath passion or admiration in all the changes of that which is called fortune from without, or the wily suttleties and refluxes of mans thoughts from within, all these things with a solid and treatable smoothnesse to paint out and describe. Teaching over the whole book of sanctity and vertu through all the instances of example with such delight to those especially of soft and delicious temper who will not so much as look upon Truth herselfe, unlesse they see her elegantly drest, that whereas the paths of honesty and good life appear now rugged and difficult, though they be indeed easy and pleasant, they would then appeare to all men both easy and pleasant though they were rugged and difficult indeed. And what a benefit this would be to our youth and gentry, may be soon guest by what we know of the corruption and bane which they suck in dayly from the writings and interludes of libidinous and ignorant Poetasters, who having scars ever heard of that which is the main consistence

of a true poem, the choys of such persons as they ought to introduce, and what is morall and decent to each one, doe for 〈◊〉 most part lap up vitious principles in sweet pils to be swallowed down, and make the tast of vertuous documents harsh and sowr. But because the spirit of man cannot demean it selfe lively in this body without some recreating intermission of labour, and serious things, it were happy for the Common wealth, if our Magistrates, as in those famous governments of old, would take into their care, not only the deciding of our contentious Law cases and brauls, but the managing of our publick sports, and festival pastimes, that they might be, not such as were autorized a while since, the provaction• of drunkennesse and lust, but such as may inure and harden o• bodies by martial exercises to all warlike skil and performance, and may civilize, adom and make discreet our minds by the learned and affable meeting of frequent Academies, and the procurement of wise and artfull recitations sweetned with • oquent and gracefull inticements to the love and practice of justice, temperance and fortitude, instructing and bettering the Nation at all opportunities, that the call of wisdom and vertu may be heard every where, a• 
         salomon saith, she crieth without, she uttereth her voice in the streets, in the top of high places, in the chief concours, and in the openings of the Gates. Whether this may not be not only in Pulpits, but after another persuasive method, at set and solemn Paneguries, in Theaters, porches, or what other place, or way may win most upon the people to receiv at once both recreation, & instruction, let them in autority consult. The thing which I had to say, and those intentions which have lived within me ever since I could conceiv my self any thing worth to my Countrie, I return to crave excuse that urgent reason hath pluckt from me by an abortive and foredated discovery. And the accom• lishment of them lies not but in a power above mans to promise; but that none hath by more studious ways endeavoured, and with more unwearied spirit that none shall, that I dare almost averre of my self, as farre as life and free leasure will extend, and that the Land had once infranchised her self from this impertinent yoke of prelaty, under whose Inquisitorins and tyra• ical duncery no free and splendid wit can flourish. Neither doe I think it shame to covnant with any knowing reader, that for some few yeers yet I may go on trust with him toward the payment of what I am now indebted, as being a work not to be raysed from the heat of youth, or the vapours of wine, like that which

flows at wast from the pen of some vulgar • Word• , or the trencher fury of a riming parasite, nor to be obtained by the invocation of Dame Memory and her siren daughters, but by devout prayer to that eternall spirit who can enrich with all utterance and knowledge, and sends out his seraphim with the hallowed fire of his Altar to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases: to this must be added industrious and select reading, steddy observation, insight into all seemly and generous arts and affaires, till which in some measure be compast, at mine own peril and cost I refuse not to sustain this expectation from as many as are not loath to hazard so much credulity upon the best pledges that I can g• ve them. Although it nothing content me to have disclosed thus much before hand, but that I trust hereby to make it manifest with what small willingnesse I endure to interrupt the pursuit of no lesse hopes then these, and leave a calme and pleasing solitaryn• s fed with cherful and confident thou• hts, to imbark in a troubled sea of noises and hoars disputes, put from beholding the bright countenance of truth in the quiet and still air of delightfull studies to come into the dim reflexion of hollow antiquities sold by the seeming bulk, and there be fain to club quotations with men whose learning and beleif lies in marginal stuffings, who when they have like good sumpter• laid ye down their hors load of citations and fathers at your dore, with a rapsody of who and who were Bishops here or there, ye may take off their packsaddles, their days work is don, and episcopacy, a• they think, stoutly vindicated. Let any gentle apprehension that can distinguish learned pains from unlearned drudgery, imagin what pleasure or profoundnesse can be in this, or what honour to deaf against such adversaries. But were it the meanest under-service, if God by his secretary conscience injoyn it, it were sad for me if I should draw back, for me especially, now when all men offer their aid to help ease and enlighten the difficult labours of the Church, to whose service by the intentions of my parents and friends I was destined of a child, and in mine own resolutions, till comming to some maturity of yeers and perceaving what tyranny had invaded the Church, that he who would take Orders must subscibe slave, and take an oath withall, which unlesse he took with a conscience that would • etch he must either strait perjure, or split his faith, I thought it better to preferre a blamelesse silence before the sacred office of speaking bought, and begun with servitude and forswearing. Howsoever thus Church-outed by the Prelats, hence may appear the

right I have to meddle in these matters, as before, the necessity and constraint appeared. CHAP. I. That Prelaty opposeth the reason and end of the Gospel three ways, and first in her outward form. 
         AFter this digression it would remain that I should single o• some other reason which might undertake for Prelaty to be a fit and lawfull Church-government; but finding none of like validity with these that have alredy sped according to their fortune, I shall adde one reason why it is not to be thought a Church-government at all, but a Church-tyranny, and is at hostile terms with the end and reason of Christs Evangelick ministery. Albeit I must confesse to be half in doubt whether I should bring it forth or no, it being so contrary to the eye of the world, and the world so potent in most mens hearts, that I shall endanger either not to be regarded, or not to be understood. For who is ther almost that measures wisdom by simplicity, strength by suffering, dignity by lowlinesse, who is there that counts it first, to be last, somthing to be nothing, and reckons himself of great command in that he is a servant? yet God when he meant to subdue the world and hell a• once, part of that to salvation, and this wholy to perdition, made chois of no other weapons, or auxiliaries then these whether to save, or to destroy. It had bin a small maistery for him, to have drawn out his Legions into array, and flankt them with his thunder; therefore he sent Foolishnes to confute Wisdom, Weaknes to bind strength, Despisednes to vanquish Pride. And this is the great mistery of the Gospel made good in Christ himself, who as he testifies came not to be ministered to, but to minister; and must he fulfiled in all his ministers till his second comming. To goe against these principles s. Paul so feared, that if he should but affect the wisdom of words in his preaching, he thought it would be laid to his charge, that he had made the crosse of Christ to be of none effect Whether then Prelaty do not make of none effect the crosse of Christ by the principles it hath so contrary to these, nullifying the power and end of the Gospel, it shall not want due proof, if it want

not due belief. Neither shal I stand to trifle with one that will tell me of quiddities and formalities, whether Prelaty or Prelateity in abstract notion be this or that, it suffices me that I find it in his • kin, so I find it inseparable, or not oftner otherwise then a Pheni• hath bin seen; although I perswade me that whatever faultines was but superficial to Prelaty at the beginning, is now by the just judgment of God long since branded and inworn into the very essence therof. First therefore, if to doe the work of the Gospel Christ ou• Lord took upon him the form of a servant, how can his servant in this ministery take upon him the form of a Lord? I know Bils• 
          hath deciphered us all the galanteries of signore and Monsignore, and Monsieur as circumstantially as any punctualist of Casteel, Naples, or Fountain Blea• 
          could have don, but this must not so complement us out of our right minds, as to be to learn that the form of a servant was a mean, laborious and vulgar life aptest to teach; which form Christ thought fittest, that he might bring about his will according to his own principles choosing the meaner things of this world that he might put under the high. Now whether the pompous garb, the Lordly life, the wealth, the haughty distance of Prelaty be those meaner things of the world, wherby God in them would manage the mystery of his Gospel, be it the verdit of common sense. For Christ saith in s. Iohn, The servant is not greater then his Lord, nor he that is sent greater then he that sent him. And addes, If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do• them. Then let the prelates well advise, if they neither know, nor do these things, or if they know, and yet doe them not, wherin their happines consists. And thus is the Gospel frustrated by the Lordly form of Prelaty. CHAP. II. That the ceremonius doctrin of Prelaty opposeth the reason and end of the Gospel. THat which next declares the heavenly power, and reveales the deep mistery of the Gospel, is the pure simpl• ity of doctrine accounted the foolishnes of this world, yet crossing and confounding the pride and wisdom of the flesh. And wherin consists this

fleshly wisdom and pride? in being altogether ignorant of God and his worship? no surely, for men are naturally ashamed of th• . Where then? it consists in a bold presumption of ordering the worship and service of God after mans own will in traditions and ceremonies. Now if the pride and wisdom of the flesh were to be defeated and confounded, no doubt, but in that very point wherin it was proudest and thought it self wisest, that so the victory of the Gospel might be the more illustrious. But our Prelats instead of expressing the spirituall power of their ministery by warring against this chief bulwark and strong hold of the flesh, have entered into fast league with the principall enemy against whom they were se• , and turned the strength of fleshly pride and wisdom against the pure simplicity of saving truth. First, mistrusting to find the autority of their or• er in the immediat institution of Christ, or his Apostles by the cleer evidence of scripture, they fly to the c• nal supportment of tradition: when we appeal to the Bible, they to the unweildy volumes of tradition. And doe not shame to reject the ordinance of him that is eternal for the pervers iniquity of sixteen hunderd yeers; choosing rather to think truth it self a lyar, the• that sixteen ages should be taxe with an error; not considering the general a postasy that was foretold, and the Churches flight into the wildernes. Nor is this anough, instead of shewing the reason of their lowly condition from divine example and command, they seek to prove their high pre-eminence from humane consent and autority. But let them chaunt while they will of prerogatives, we shall tell them of scripture; of custom, we of scripture; of Acts and statutes, stil of scripture, til the quick and pearcing word enter to the dividing of their soules, & the mighty weaknes of the Gospel throw down the weak mightines of mans reasoning. Now for their demeanor within the Church, how have they disfigured and defac't that more then angelick brightnes, the unclouded serenity of Christian Religion with the dark overcasting of superstitious coaps and flaminical vestures; wearing on their backs; and, I abhorre to think, perhaps in some worse place the unexpressible Image of God the father. Tell me ye Priests wherfore this gold, wherfore these roabs and surplices over the Gospel• is our religion guilty of the first trespasse, and hath need of cloathing to cover her nakednesse? whatdoes this else but hast an ignominy upon the perfection of Christs ministery by seeking to adorn it with that which 〈◊〉 the poor remedy of our • Word• . • eleive it, wondrous Doctors, all

corporeal resemblances of inward holinesse & beauty are now past; he that will cloath the Gospel now, intimates plainly, that the Gospel is naked, uncomely, that I may not say reproachfull. Do not, ye Church maskers, while Christ is cloathing upon our barenes with his righteous garment to make us acceptable in his fathers fight, doe not, as ye do, cover and hide his righteous verity with the polluted cloathing of your ceremonies to make it seem more decent in your own eyes. How beautifull, saith Isaiah, are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth salvation! Are the feet so beautifull, and is the very bringing of these tidings so decent of it self? what new decency then can be added to this by your spinstry? ye think by these gaudy glisterings to stirre up the devotion of the rude multitude; ye think so, because ye forsake the heavenly teaching of s. Paul for the hellish sophistry of Papism. If the multitude be rude, the lips of the Preacher must give knowledge, and not ceremonies. And although some Christians be new born babes comparatively to some that are stronger, yet in respect of ceremony which is but a rudiment of the Law, the weakest Christian hath thrown off the robes of his minority, and is a perfect man, as to legal rites. What childrens food there is in the Gospel we know to be no other then the sincerity of the word that they may grow thereby. But is heer the utmost of your outbraving the service of God? No. Ye have bin bold, not to set your threshold by his threshold, or your posts by his posts, but your sacrament, your • igne, call it what you will, by his sacrament, baptizing the Christian infant with a solemne sprinkle, and unbaptizing for your own part with a profane and impious forefinger: as if when ye had layd the purifying element upon his forehead, ye meant to cancel and crosse it out again with a caracter not of Gods bidding. O but the innocence of these ceremonies! O rather the fottish absurdity of this excuse! what could be more innocent then the washing of a cup, a glasse, or hands before meat, and that under the Law when so many washings were commanded, and by long tradition, yet our saviour detested their customes though never so seeming harmlesse, and charges them severely that they had transgrest the Commandments of God by their traditions and worshipt him in vain. How much more then must these, and much grosser ceremonies now in force delude the end of Christs comming in the flesh against the flesh, and stifle the sincerity of our new cov'nant which hath bound us to forsake all carnall pride and wisdom especially in matters of

religion. Thus we see again how Prelaty sayling in opposition 〈◊〉 the main end and power of the Gospel doth not joyn in that •
         sterious work of Christ, by lowlines to confound height, by simplicity of doctrin the wisdom of the world, but contrariwise hath made it self high in the world and the flesh to vanquish things by the world accounted low, and made it self wise in tradition and fleshly ceremony to confound the purity of doctrin which is the wisdom of God. CHAP. III. That Prelatical jurisdiction opposeth the reason and end of the Gospel and of state. THe third and last consideration remains, whether the Prelats in their function doe work according to the Gospel practizing to subdue the mighty things of this world by things weak: which s. Paul hath set forth to be the power and excellence of the Gospel, or whether in more likelihood they band themselves with the prevalent things of this world to overrun the weak things which Christ hath made chois to work by: and this will soonest be discerned by the cours of their jurisdiction. But heer again I find my thoughts almost in suspense betwixt yea and no, and am nigh turning mine eye which way I may best retire, and not proceed in this subject, blaming the ardency of my mind that fixt me too attentively to come thus farre. For Truth, I know not how, hath this unhappinesse fatall to her, ere she can come to the triall and inspection of the Understanding, being to passe through many little wards and limits of the severall Affections and Desires, she cannot shift it, but must put on such colours and attire, as those Pathetick handmaids of the soul please to lead her in to their Queen. And if she find so much favour with them, they let her passe in her own likenesse; if not, they bring her into the presence habited and coloured like a notorious Falshood. And contrary when any Falshood comes that way, if they like the • rrand she brings, they are so artfull to counterfeit the very shape and visage of Truth, that the Understanding not being able to discern the • ucus which these inchantresses with such cunning have laid upon the feature sometimes

of Truth, sometimes of Falshood interchangeably, sentences for the most part one for the other at the first blush, according to the suttle imposture of these sensual mistresses that keep the port• and passages between her and the object. so that were it not for leaving imperfect that which is already said, I should goe neer to relinquish that which is to follow. And because I see that most men, as it happens in this world, either weakly, or falsly principled, what through ignorance, and what through custom of licence, both in discours and writing, by what hath bin of late written in vulgar, have not seemed to attain the decision of this point, I shall likewise assay those wily Arbitresses who in most men have, as was heard, the sole ushering of Truth and Falshood between the sense, and the soul, with what loyalty they will use me in conuoying this Truth to my understanding; the rather for that by as much acquaintance as I can obtain with them, I doe not find them engaged either one way or other. Concerning therfore ecclefial jurisdiction, I find still more controversie, who should administer it, then diligent enquiry made to learn what it is, for had the pains bin taken to search out that, it had bin long agoe enrouled to be nothing el• but a pure tyrannical forgery of the Prelats; and that jurisdictive power in the Church there ought to be none at all. It cannot be conceived that what men now call jurisdiction in the Church, should be other thing then a Christian censorship; and therefore is it most commonly and truly named ecclesiastical censure. Now if the Roman censor a civil function, to that severe assise of survaying and controuling the privatest, and sliest manners of all men and all degrees had no jurisdiction, no courts of plea, or inditement, no punitive force annext, whether it were that to this manner of correction the intanglement of suits was improper, or that the notic• of those upright Inquisitors extended to such the most covert and spiritous vices as would slip easily between the wider and mo• e material grasp of Law; Or that it stood more with the Majesty of that office to have no other serjeants or maces about them but thos• invisible ones of Terror and shame: Or lastly, were it their feare, lest the greatnes of this autority and honour armed with jurisdiction might step with ease into a tyranny. In all these respects with much more reason undoubtedly ought the censure of the Church be quite devested and disintaled of all jurisdiction whatsoever. For if the cours of judicature to a political censorship seem either too t• dions, or too contentions, much more may it to the discipline of

Church whose definitive decrees are to be speedy, but the execution of rigour slow, contrary to what in legal proceedings is mo• usual, and by how much the lesse contentious it is, by so much will it be the more Christian. And if the censor in his morall episcopy being to judge most in matters not answerable by writ or action could not use an instrument so grosse and bodily as jurisdiction is, how can the minister of Gospel manage the corpulent and secular trial of bill and processe in things meerly spiritual. Or could that Roman office without this juridical sword or saw strike such a reverence of it self into the most undaunted hearts, as with one single dash of ignominy to put all the senate and Knighthood of R• 
          into a tremble, surely much rather might the heavenly ministery of the Evangel bind her self about with farre more pearcing beams of Majesty and aw by wanting the beggarly help of halings and amercements in the use of her powerful Keies. For when the Church without temporal support is able to doe her great works upon the unforc't obedience of men, it argues a divinity about her. But when she thinks to credit and better her spirituall efficacy, and to win her self respect and dread by strutting in the fals visard of worldly autority, tis evident that God is not there; but that her apostolick vertu is departed from her, and hath left her Key-cold. Which she perceaving as in a decaied nature seeks to the outward fomentations and chafings of worldly help, and external flourishes, to fetch, if it be possible, some motion into her extream parts, orto hatch a counterseit life with the crafty and arteficial heat of jurisdiction. But it is observable that so long as the Church in tr• e imitat• on of Christ can be content to ride upon an Asse carrying her self and her government along in a mean and simple guise, she may be as he is, a Lion of the tribe of Iuda, and in her humility all men with loud Hosanna's will confesse her greatnes. But when despising the mighty operation of the spirit by the weak things of this world she thinks to make her self bigger and more considerable by using the way of civil force and jurisdiction, as she sits upon this Lion she changes into an Asse, and instead of Hosanna's every man pel• s her with stones and dirt. Lastly, if the wisdom of the Romans feared to commit jurisdiction to an office of so high esteem and d• d as wa• the con• ors, we may see what a solecism in the art of policy it hath bin all this while through Christendom to g• jurisdiction to ecclesiastical Censure. For that strength joyned with religion abused and pretended to ambitions ends must of necessity

breed the heaviest and most quellingty ranny not only upon the necks, but even to the souls of men: which if Christian Rome had bin so cautelous to prevent in her Church, as Pagan Rome was in herstate, we had not had such a lamentable experience thereof as now we have from thenceupon all Christendom. For although I said before that the Church coveting to ride upon the Lionly form of jurisdiction makes a transformation of her self into an Asse, and becomes despicable, that is to those whom God hath enlight'nd with true knowledge; but where they remain yet in the reliques of superstition, this is the extremity of their bondage, and blindnes, that while they think they doe obeisance to the Lordly visage of a Lion, they doe it to an asse, that through the just judgement of God is permitted to play the dragon among them because of their wilfull stupidity. And let England here well rub her eyes, lest by leaving jurisdiction and Church censure to the same persons, now that God hath bin so long medcining her eyesight, she do• not w• her overpolitick fetches marre all, and bring her self back again to worship this Asse bestriding a Lion. Having hit herto explained, that to ecclesiasticall censure no jurisdictive power can be added without a childish and dangerous oversight in polity, and a pernicious contradiction in evangelick discipline, as anon more fully; it will be next to declare wherin the true reason and force of Church censure consists, which by then it shall be laid open to the root, so little is it that I fear lest any crookednes, any wrincle or spo• should be found in presbyterial governnient that if Bodin the famo• French • r though a • apist, yet affirms that the Commonwelth which maintains this discipline will certainly flourish in vertu and piety, I dare assure my self that every true protestant will admire the integrity, the uprightnes, the divine and gracious purposes therof, and even for the reason of it so coherent with the doctrine of the Gospel, besides the evidence of command in scripture, will confesse it to be the only true Church-government, and that contrary to the whole end and m• ry of Christs comming in the flesh a false appearance of the same is exercised by Prelaty. But because some count it rigorous, and that hereby men shall be liable to a double punishment, I will begin somwhat higher and speak of punishment. Which, as i• is an evil, I esteem t• be of two forty, or rather two degrees only, a reprobat conscience in this life, and hell in the other world. Whatever else men • l punishment, or censure is not properly an evil, so it be not an illegall violence, but a saving

med'cin ordained of God both for the publik and privat good 〈◊〉 man, who consisting of two parts the inward and the outward, 〈◊〉 by the eternall providence left under two sorts of cure, the Church and the Magistrat. The Magistrat hath only to deale with the outward part, I mean not of the body alone, but of the mind in all her outward acts, which in scripture is called the outward man. so that it would be helpfull to us if we might borrow such autority 〈◊〉 the Rhetoricians by pa• ent may give us, with a kind of Prometh• skill to shape and fashion this outward man into the similitude 〈◊〉 a body, and set him visible before us; imagining the inner man only as the soul. Thus then the civill Magistrat looking only upon the outward man (I say as a Magistrat, for what he doth further, he doth it as a member of the Church) if he find in his complexion, skin, or outward temperature the signes and marks, or in his doings the effects of injustice, rapine, lost, cruelty, or the like, sometimes he shuts up as in frenetick, or infectious diseases; or confines within dores, as in every sickly estate. sometimes he shaves by penalty, or mulct, or els to cool and take down those luxuriant humors which wealth and excesse have caused to abound. Otherwhiles he ser• , he cauterizes, he scarifies, lets blood, and finally for utmost remedy cuts off. The patients which mostanend are brought into his hospital are such as are farre gon, and beside themselves (unlesse they be falsly accused) so that force is necessary to tame and quiet them 〈◊〉 their unruly fits, before they can be made capable of a more human • ure. His general end is the outward peace and wel-fare of the Commonwealth and civil happines in this life. His p• ular • nd in every man is, by the infliction of pain, dammage, a• disgrace, that the senses and common perceivance might carry this message to the soul within, that it is neither easefull, profitable, nor praisworthy in this life to doe evill. Which must needs tend to the good of man, whether he be to live or die; and be undoubtedly the f• means to a natural man, especially an offender, which might open his eyes to a higher consideration o• good and evill, as it is taught in religion. This is seen in the often penitence of those that suffer, who, had they scapt, had gon on sinning to an immeasurable hea• , which is one of the extreamest punishments. And this is all that the civil Magistrat, as so being, conser• to the healing of mans mind, working only by terrifying 〈◊〉 upon the rind & orifice of the • ore, and by all outward appli• , as the Logicians say, a post• , at the effect, and not from the cause: not once touching th•
         
inward bed of corruption, and that hectick disposition to evill, the sourse of all vice, and obliquity against the rule of Law. Which how insufficient it is to cure the soul of man, we cannot better guesse then by the art of bodily phisick. Therfore God to the intent of further healing mans depraved mind, to this power of the Magistrat which contents it self with the restraint of evil doing in the external man, added that which we call censure, to purge it and remove it clean out of the inmost soul. In the beginning this autority seems to have bin plac't, as all both civil and religious rites once were, only in each father of family. Afterwards among the heathen, in the wise men and Philosophers of the age; but so as it was a thing voluntary, and no set government. More distinctly among the Jews as being Gods peculiar, where the Priests, Levites, Profets, and at last the scribes and Pharises took charge of instructing, and overseeing the lives of the people. But in the Gospel, which is the straitest and the dearest cov'nant can be made between God and man, wee being now his adopted sons, and nothing fitter for us to think on, then to be like him, united to him, and as he pleases to expresse it, to have fellowship with him, it is all necessity that we should expect this blest efficacy of healing our inward man to be ministered to us in a more familiar and effectual method then ever before. God being now no more a judge after the sentence of the Law, nor as it were a school maister of perishable rites, but a most indulgent father governing his Church as a family of sons in their discreet age; and therfore in the sweetest and mildest manner of paternal discipline he hath committed this other office of preserving in healthful constitution the innerman, which may be termed the spirit of the soul, to his spiritual deputy the minister of each Congregation; who being best acquainted with his own flock, h• th best reason to know all the secret• st diseases likely to be, there. And look by how much the inter• 
         • an is more excellant and noble then the external, by so muc• 
         〈◊〉 his cure more exactly, more throughly, and more particularly to be performed. For which cause the holy Ghost by the Apostles joyned to the minister, as assistant in this great office sometimes a certain number of grave and faithful brethren, (for neither doth the phisitian doe all in restoring his patient, he prescribes, another prepares the med'cin, some read, some watch, some visit) much more may a minister partly not see all, partly erre as a man: besides that nothing can be more for the mutuall honour and love of the people to their

Pastor, and his to them, then when in select numb• and cours• they are seen partaking, and doing reverence to the holy 〈◊〉 discipline by their serviceable, and solemn presence, and receiving honour again from their imployment, not now any more to be separated in the Church by vails and partitions as laicks and unclean, but admitted to wait upon the tabernacle as the rightfull Clergy of Christ, a chosen generation, a royal Priesthood to off• up spiritual sacrifice in that meet place to which God and the Congregation shall call and assigne them. And this all Christians ought to know, that the title of Clergy s. Peter gave to all Gods people, till Pope Higinus and the succeeding Prelates took it from them, appropriating that name to themselves and their Priests only; and condemning the rest of Gods inheritance to an injurious and alienat condition of Laity, they separated from them by local partitions in Churches, through their gr• sse ignorance and pride imitating the old temple: and excluded the members of Christ from the property of being members, the bearing of orderly and fit offices in the ecclesiastical body, as if they had meant to sow up that Iewish vail which Christ by his death on the Crosse rent in sunder. Although these usurpers could not so: presently over-maister the liberties and lawfull titles of Gods freeborn Church, but that Origen being yet a lay man expounded the scriptures publickly, and was therein defended by Alexander of Jerusalem, and Theoctistus of Caesarea producing in his behalf divers examples that the privilege of teaching was anciently permitted to many worthy Laymen; And Cyprian in his Epistles professes he will doe nothing without the advice and assent of his assistant Laicks. Neither did the first Nicene councel, as great and learned as it was, think it any robbery to receive in, and require the help and presence of many learned lay brethren, as they were then calld. Many other autorities to confirm this assertion bot• 
         〈◊〉 of scripture and the writings of next antiquity Golartius hath collected in his notes upon Cyprian; whereby it will be evident that the Laity not only by Apostolick permission, but by consent of many the aucientest Prelates did participat in Church offices as much as is desired any lay Elder should now do. sometimes also not the Elders alone, but the whole body of the Church is interested in the work of discipline, as 〈◊〉 as publick satisfaction is given by those that have given publick scandal. Not to speak now of her right in elections. But another reason there is in it, which though religion did not commend to us, yet morall

and civil prudence could not but extol. It was thought of old in Philosophy, that shame or to call it better, the reverence of our elders, our brethren, and friends was the greatest incitement to vertuous deeds and the greatest dissuasion from unworthy attempts that might • Word• . Hence we may read in the Iliad where Hector being wisht to retire si ō the battel, many of his forces being routed, makes answer that he durst not for shame, lest the Trojan Knights and Dames should think he did ignobly. And certain it is that wheras Terror is thought such a great stickler in a Commonwealth, honourable shame is a farre greater, and has more reason• For where shame is there is fear, but where fear is there is not presently shame. And if any thing may be done to inbreed in us this generous and Christianly reverence one of another, the very Nurs and Guardian of piety and vertue, it can not sooner be then by such a discipline in the Church, as may use us to have in aw the assemblies of the faithful, & to count it a thing most grievous, next to the grieving of Gods spirit, to offend those whom he hath put in autority, as a healing superintendence over our lives and behaviours, both to our own happines and that we may not give offence to good men, who without amends by us made, dare not against Gods command hold communion with us in holy things. And this will be accompanied with a religious dred of being outcast from the company of saints, and from the fatherly protection of God in his Church, to consort with the devil and his angels. But there is yet a more ingenuous and noble degree of honest shame, or call it if you will an esteem, whereby men bear an inward reverence toward their own persons. And if the love of God as a fire sent from Heaven to be ever kept alive upon the altar of our hearts, be the first principle of all godly and vertuous actions in men, this pious and just honouring of our selves is the second, and may be thought as the radical moisture and fountain head, whence every laudable and worthy enterpri• issues forth. And although I have giv'n it the name of a liquid thing, yet is it not incontinent to bound it self, as humid things are, but hath in it a most restraining and powerfull abstinence to start back, and glob it self upward from the mixture of any ungenerous and unbeseeming motion, or any soile • ewith it may peril to stain it self. something I confesse it is to • ed of evil doing in the presence of any, and to reverence the opinion and the countenance of a good man rather then a bad, fearing most in his • ght to offend, goes so farre as almost to be vertuous; yet this is but still the feare

of infamy, and many such, when they find themselves alone, 〈◊〉 their reputation will compound with other scruples, and co• close treaty with their dearer vices in secret. But he that holds himself in reverence and due esteem, both for the dignity of Gods 〈◊〉 upon him, and for the price of his redemption, whi• he thin• 
         〈◊〉 visibly markt upon his forehead, accounts himselfe both a fit person to do the noblest and godliest deeds, and much better worth then to deject and defile, with such a debasement and such a pollution as sin is, himselfe so highly ransomed and enobled to a new friendship and filiall relation with God. Nor can he fear so much the offence and reproach of others, as he dreads and would 〈◊〉 at the reflection of his own severe and modest eye upon him• , if it should see him doing or imagining that which is sinfull though in the deepest secrecy. How shall a man know to do himselfe this right, how to performe this honourable duty of estimation and respect towards his own soul and body? which way will leade 〈◊〉 best to this hill top of sanctity and goodness• above which there is no higher ascent but to the love of God which from this self-pious regard cannot be assunder? no better way doubtlesse then to let him duly understand that as he is called by the high calling of God to be holy and pure, so is he by the same appointment ordained, and by the Churches call admitted to such offices of discipline in the Church to which his owne spirituall gifts by the example of Apostolick institution have autorized him. For we have learnt that the scornfull terme of Laick, the consecrating of Temples, carpets, and table-clothes, • he railing in of a repugnant and contradictive Mount sinai in the Gospell, as if the touch of a lay Christian who is never the lesse Gods living temple, could profane dead judaisms, the exclusion of Christs people from the offices of holy discipline through the pride of a usurping Clergy, causes the rest to have an unworthy and object opinion of themselves; to approach to holy, duties with a slavish fear, • nd to unholy doings with a familiar • ldnesse. For seeing such a wide and terrible distance between religious things and themselves, and that in respect of a woodden table & the perimeter of holy ground about it, a flagon pot, and 〈◊〉 corporal, the Priest 〈◊〉 their lay-ships unhallowed and • Word• , they fear religion with such a fear as loves not, and think the p• rity of the Gospell too pure for them, and that any uncleannesse is more sutable to their 〈◊〉 estate. But when every good Christian throughly acquainted

with all those glorious privileges of sanctification and adoption which render him more sacred then any dedicated altar or element, shall be restored to his right in the Church, and not excluded from such place of spirituall government as his Christian abilities and his approved good life in the eye and testimony of the Church shall preferre him to, this and nothing sooner will open his eyes to a wise and true valuation of himselfe, which is so requisite and high a point of Christianity, and will stirre him up to walk worthy the honourable and grave imployment wherewith God and the Church hath dignified him: not fearing left he should meet with some outward holy thing in religion which his lay touch or presence might profane, but lest something unholy from within his own heart should dishonour and profane in himselfe that Priestly unction and Clergy-right whereto Christ hath entitled him. Then would the congregation of the Lord soone recover the true likenesse and visage of what she is indeed, a holy generation, a royall Priesthood, a saintly communion, the houshold and City of God. And this I hold to be another considerable reason why the functions of Church-government ought to be free and open to any Christian man though never so laick, if his capacity, his faith, and prudent demeanour commend him. And this the Apostles warrant us to do. But the Prelats object that this will bring profanenesse into the Church, to whom may be replied, that none have brought that in more then their own irreligious courses; nor more 〈◊〉 holinesse out of living into livelesse things. For whereas God who hath cleansed every beast and creeping worme, would not suffer s. Peter to call them common or unclean, the Prelat Bishops in their printed orders hung up in Churches have proclaimed the best of creatures, mankind, so unpurified and contagious, that for him to lay his hat, or his garment upon the Chancell table they have defined it no lesse hainous in expresse words then to profane the Table of the Lord. And thus have they by their Canaanitish doctrine (for that which was to th• Jew but jewish is to the Christian no better then Canaanitish) thus have they made common and unclean, thus have they made profane that nature which God hath not only cleansed, but Christ also hath assumed. And now that the equity and just reason is so perspicuous, why in Ecclesiasic• censure the assistance should be added of such, 〈◊〉 whom not the vile odour of gaine and fees (forbid it God and blow it with a whirle
         • out of our land) but charity, neighbourhood, and duty to Church-government hath called together, where could a wiseman

wish a more equall, gratuitous, and meek examination of 〈◊〉 offence that he might happen to commit against Christianity 〈◊〉 here? would he preferre those proud simoniacall Courts? 〈◊〉 therefore the Minister assisted attends his heavenly and spirituall cure. Where we shall see him both in the course of his proceeding, and first in the excellence of his end from the magistrate farre different, and not more different then excelling. His end is to recover all that is of man both soul and body to an everlasting health: and yet as for worldly happinesse, which is the proper sphere wherein the magistrate cannot but confine his motion without a hideous exorbitancy from law, so little aims the Minister, as his intended scope, to procure the much prosperity of this life, that oft-times he may have cause to wish much of it away, a• a diet puffing up the soul with a slimy fleshinesse, and weakning her principall organick parts. Two heads of evill he has to cope with, ignorance and malice. Against the former he provides the daily Manna of incorruptible doctrine, not at those set meales only in publick, but as oft as he shall know that each infirmity, or constitution requires. Against the latter with all the branches thereof, not medling with that restraining and styptick surgery which tho law uses, not indeed against the malady but against the eruptions, and outermost effects thereof. He on the contrary beginning at the prime causes and roo• of the disease sends in those two divine ingredients of most cleansing power to the soul, Admonition & Reproof, besides which two there is no drug or antidote that can reach to purge the mind, and without which all other experiments are but vain, unlesse by •
         dent. And he that will not let these passe into him, though he be the greatest King, as Plato affirms, must be thought to remaine impure within, and unknowing of those things wherein his purenesse and his knowledge should most appear. As soon therefore as it may be discerned that the Christian patient by feeding 〈◊〉 here on meats not allowable, but of evill juice, hath disordered his diet, and spread an ill humour through his 〈◊〉 immediatly disposing to a sicknesse, the minister as being much neerer both in eye and duty, then the magistrats, speeds him betimes to overtake that diffused malignance with some gentle potion of admonishment; or if ought be obstructed, puts in his opening and disenssive con• . This not succeeding after once or twice or oftner, in the 〈◊〉 of two or three his faithfull brethren appointed thereto be advis• him to be more carefull of his dearest health, and what it is that he

so rashly hath let down in to the divine vessel of his soul Gods temple. If this obtaine not, he then with the counsell of more assistants who are informed of what diligence hath been already used, with more speedy remedies layes neerer siege to the entrenched causes of his distemper, not sparing such servent and well aimed reproofs as may best give him to see the dangerous estate wherein he is. To this also his brethren and friends intreat, exhort, adjure, and all these endeavours, as there is hope left, are more or lesse repeated. But if, neither the regard of himselfe, nor the reverence of his Elders and friends prevaile with him, to leave his vitious appetite, then as the time urges, such engines of terror God hath given into the hand of his minister as to search the tenderest angles of the heart: one while he shakes his stubbornnesse with racking convulsions nigh dispaire, other whiles with deadly corrosives he gripes the very roots of his faulty liver to bring him to life through the entry of death. Hereto the whole Church beseech him, beg of him, deplore him, pray for him. After all this performed with what patience and attendance is possible, and no relenting on his part, having done the utmost of their cure, in the name of God and of the Church they dissolve their fellowship with him, and holding forth the dreadfull sponge of excommunion pronounce him wip't out of the list of Gods inheritance, and in the custody of satan till he repent. Which horrid sentence though it touch neither life, nor limme, nor any worldly possession, yet has it such a penetrating force, that swifter then any chimicall sulphur, or that lightning which harms not the skin, and rifles the entrals, it scorches the inmost soul. Yet even this terrible denouncement is left to the Church for no other cause but to be as a rough and vehement cleansing medcin, where the malady is obdurat; a mortifying to life, a kind of saving by undoing. And it may be truly said, that as the mercies of wicked men are cruelties, so the cruelties of the Church are mercies. For if repentance sent from heaven meet this lost wanderer, and draw him out of that steep journey wherein he was hasting towards destruction, to come and reconcile to the Church, if he bring with him his bill of health, and that he is now cleare of infection and of no danger to the other sheep, then with incredible expressions of joy all his brethren receive him, and set before him those perfumed bankets of Christian consolation; with pretious ointments bathing and somenting the old and now to be forgotten stripes which terror and shame had inflicted; and thus with heavenly solaces they cheere up

his humble remorse, till he regain his first health and felicity. This is the approved way which the Gospell prescribes, these are the spirituall weapons of holy censure, and ministeriall warfare, not carnall, but mighty through God to the pulling downe of strong holds, casting 
         Cor. 2. 10. 
         down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it selfe against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. What could be done more for the healing and reclaming that divine particle of Gods breathing the soul, and what could be done lesse? he that would hide his faults from such a wholsome curing as this, and count it a two-fold punishment; as some do, is like a man that having foul diseases about him, perishes for shame, and the fear he has o• a rigorous incision to come upon hi• flesh. We shall be able by this time to discern whether Prelaticall jurisdiction be contrary to the Gospell or no. First therefore the government of the Gospell being economicall and paternall, that is, of such a family where there be no servants, but all sons in obedience, not in servility, as cannot be denied by him that lives but within the sound of scripture, how can the Prelates justifie to have turned the fatherly orders of Christs houshold, the blessed meeknesse of his lowly roof, those ever open and inviting dores of his dwelling house which delight to be frequented with only filiall accesses, how can they justifie to have turned these domestick privileges into the barre of a proud judiciall court where fees and clamours keep shop and drive a trade, w• ere bribery and corruption solicits, paltring the free and monilesse power of discipline with a carnall satisfaction by the purse. Contrition, humiliation, confession, the very sighs of a repentant spirit are there sold by the penny. That undefloured and unblemishable simplicity of the Gospell, not she her selfe for that could never be, but a false-whi• ed, a lawnie resemblance of her, like that aire-born Helena in the fables, made by the sorcery of Prelats, instead of calling her Disciples from the receit of custome, is now turned Publican her self; and gives up her body to a mercenary whor• ome under those fornicated ches which she cals Gods house, and in the fight of those her altars which she hath set up to be adored makes merchandize of the bodies and souls of men. Rejecting purgatory for no other reason, as it seems, then because her greedines cannot deferre • ut had rather use the utmost extortion of redeemed penances in this life. But because these matters could not be thus carried without a begged and borrowed force from worldly autority, therefore prelaty slighting

the deliberat• d chosen counsell of Christ in his spirituall government, whose glory is in the weaknesse of fleshly things to t• ad upon the crest of the worlds pride and violence by the power of spirituall ordinances, hath on the contrary made these her freinds and champions which are Christs enemies in this his high designe, smothering and extinguishing the spirituall force of his bodily weaknesse in the discipline of his Church with the boistrous and carnall tyranny of an undue, unlawfull and ungospellike jurisdiction. And thus Prelaty both in her fleshly supportments, in her carnall doctrine of ceremonie and tradition, in her violent and secular power going quite counter to the prime end of Christs comming in the flesh, that is to revele his truth, his glory and his might in a clean contrary manner then Prelaty seeks to do, thwarting and defeating the great mistery of God, I do not conclude that Prelaty is Antichristian, for what need I? the things themselves conclude it. Yet if such like practises, and not many worse then these of our Prelats, in that great darknesse of the Roman Church, have not exempted both her and her present members from being judged to be Antichristian in all orthodoxall esteeme, I cannot think but that it is the absolute voice of truth and all her children to pronounce this Prelaty, and these her dark deeds in the midst of this great light wherein we live, to be more Antichristian then Antichrist himselfe. "
"12","HOw happy were it for this frail, and as it may be truly called, mortall life of man, since all earthly things which have the name of good and convenient in our daily use, are withall so cumbersome and full of trouble if knowledge yet which is the best and, lightsomest possession of the mind, were as the common saying is, no burden, and that what it wanted of being a load to any part of the body, it did not with a heavie advantage overlay upon the spirit. For not to speak of that knowledge that rests in the contemplation of naturall causes and dimensions, which must needs be a lower wisdom, as the object is low, certain it is that he who hath obtained in more then the scantest measure to know any thing distinctly of God, and of his true worship, and what is infallibly good and happy in the state of mans life, what in it selfe evil and miserable, though vulgarly not so esteemed, he that hath obtained to know this, the only high valuable wisdom indeed, remembring also that God even to a strictnesse requires the improvment of these his entrusted gifts cannot but sustain a sore• burden of mind, and more pressing then any supportable toil, or waight, which the body can labour under; how and in what manner he shall dispose and employ those summes of knowledge and illumination, which God hath sent him into this world to trade with. And that which aggravats the burden more is, that having received amongst his allotted parcels certain pretious truths of such an orient lustre as no Diamond can equall, which never the lesse he has in charge to put off at any cheap rate, yea for nothing to them that will, the great Marchants of this world searing that this cours would soon discover, and disgrace the fals glitter of their deceitfull wares wherewith they abuse the people, like poor Indians with beads and glasses,

practize by all means how they may suppresse the venting of such rarities and such a cheapnes as would undoe them, and turn their trash upon their hands. Therefore by gratifying the corrupt desi• of men in fleshly doctrines, they stirre them up to persecute with hatred and contempt all those that seek to bear themselves uprightly in this their spiritual factory: which they forseeing though they cannot but testify of Tr• th and the excellence of t• at heavenly traffick which they bring against what opposition, or danger soever, yet needs must it sit heavily upon their spirits, that being in Gods prime intention and their own, selected heralds of peace, and dispensers of treasures inestimable without price to them that have no pence, they finde in the discharge of their commission that they are made the greatest variance and offence, a very sword and fire both in house and City over the whole earth. This is that which the sad Prophet Ieremiah laments, Wo is me my mother, that thou hast born me a man of strife, and contention. And although divine inspiration must certainly have been sweet to those ancient profets, yet the irksomnesse of that truth which they brought was so unpleasant to them, that every where they call it a burden. Yea that mysterious book of Revelation which the great Evangelist was bid to eat, as it had been some eye-brightning electuary of knowledge, and foresight, though it were sweet in his mouth, and in the learning, it was bitter in his belly; bitter in the denouncing. Nor was this hid from the wise Poet sophocles, who in that place of his Tragedy where Tirefias is called to resolve K. Edipus in a matter which he knew would be grievous, brings him in bemoaning his lot, that he knew more then other men. For surely to every good and peaceable man it must in nature needs be a hatefull thing to be the displeaser, and molester of thousands; much better would it like him doubtlesse to be the messenger of gladnes and contentment, which is his chief intended busines, to all mankind, but that they resist and oppose their own true happinesse. But when God commands to take the trumpet and blow a dolorous or a jarring blast, it lies not in mans will what he shall say, or what he shall conceal. If he shall think to be silent, as Ieremiah did, because of the reproach and derision he met with daily, and all his familiar friends watcht for his halting to be revenged on him for speaking the truth, he would be forc'• to confesse as he confest, his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, I was weary with forbearing, and could not stay. Which might teach these times not suddenly to condemn all

things that are sharply spoken, or vehemently written, as proceeding out of stomach, virulence and ill nature, but to consider rather that if the Prelats have leav to say the worst that can be said, and doe the worst that can be don, while they strive to keep to themselves to their great pleasure and commodity those things which they ought to render up, no man can be justly offended with him that shall endeavour to impart and bestow without any gain to himselfe those sharp, but saving words which would be a terror, and a torment in him to keep back. For me I have determined to lay up as the best treasure, and solace of a good old age, if God voutsafe it me, the honest liberty of free speech from my youth, where I shall think it available in so dear a concernment as the Churches good. For if I be either by disposition, or what other cause too inquisitive, or suspitious of my self and mine own doings, who can help it? but this I foresee, that should the Church be brought under heavy oppression, and God have given me ability the while to reason against that man that should be the author of so foul a deed, or should she by blessing from above on the industry and courage of faithfull men change this her distracted estate into better daies without the lest furtherance or contribution of those few talents which God at that present had lent me, I foresee what stories I should heare within my selfe, all my life after, of discourage and reproach. Timorous and ingratefull, the Church of God is now again at the foot of her insulting enemies: and thou bewailst, what matters it for thee or thy bewailing? when time was, thou couldst not find a syllable of all that thou hadst read, or studied, to utter in her behalfe. Yet ease and leasure was given thee for thy retired thoughts out of the sweat of other men. Thou hadst the diligence the parts, the language of a man, if a vain subject were to be adorned or beautified, but when the cause of God and his Church was to be pleaded, for which purpose that tongue was given thee which thou hast, God listened if he could heare thy voice among his zealous servants, but thou wert domb as a beast; from hence forward be that which thine own brutish silence hath made thee. Or else I should have heard on the other care, slothfull, and ever to be set light by, the Church hath now overcom her late distresses after the unwearied labours of many her true servants that stood up in her defence; thou also wouldst take upon thee to share amongst them of their joy: but wherefore tho• where canst thou shew any word or deed of thine which might have ha• tened her peace; whatever

thou dost now talke; or write, or look is the almes of other me• active prudence and zeale. Dare not now to say, or doe any thing better then thy former sloth and infancy, or if thou darst, thou dost impudently to make a thrifty purchase of boldnesse to thy selfe out of the painfull merits of other men: what before was thy sin, is now thy duty to be, abject, and worthlesse. These and such like lessons as these, I know would have been my Matins duly, • nd my Even-song. But now by this litle diligence, mark what a privilege I have gained; with good men and saints to clame my right of lamenting the tribulations of the Church, if she should suffer, when others that have ventured nothing for her sake, have not the honour to be admitted mourners. But if she lift up her drooping head and prosper, among those that have something more then wisht her welfare, I have my charter and freehold of rejoycing to me and my heires. Concerning therefore this way ward subject against prelaty, the touching whereof is so distastfull and disquietous to a number of men, as by what hath been said I may deserve of charitable readers to be credited, that neither envy nor gall hath ente• d me upon this controversy, but the enforcement of conscience only, and a preventive fear least the omitting of this duty should be against me when I would store up to my self the good provision of peacefull hours, so lest it should be still imputed to me, as I have found i• hath bin, that some self-pleasing humor of vain-glory hath incited me to contest with men of high estimation now while green yeer• are upon my head, from this needlesse sor• isall I shall hope to disswade the intelligent and equal auditor, if I can but say succesfully that which in this exigent behoovs me, although I would be heard only, if it might be, by the elegant & learned reader, to whom principally for a while I shal beg leav I may addresse my selfe. To him it will be no new thing though I tell him that if I hunted after praise by the ostentation of wit and learning, I should not write thus out of mine own season, when I have neither yet compleated to my minde the full circle of my private studies, although I complain not of any insufficiency to the matter in hand, or were I ready to my wishes, it were a folly to cōmit any thing elaborately composed to the carelesse and interrupted listening of these tumultuous timer. Next if I were wise only to mine own ends, I would certainly take such a subject as of it self might catch applause, whereas this hath all the disadvantages on the contrary, and such a subject as the publishing whereof might be delayd at pleasure, and time enough to

pencill it over with all the curious touches of art, even to the perfection of a faultlesse picture, whenas in this argument the not deferring is of great moment to the good speeding, that if solidity have leisure to doe her office, art cannot have much. Lastly, I should not chuse this manner of writing wherin knowing my self inferior to my self, led by the genial power of nature to another task, I have the use, as I may account it, but of my left hand. And though I shall be foolish in saying more to this purpose, yet since it will be such a folly as wisest men going about to commit, have only confest and so committed, I may trust with more reason, because with more folly to have courteous pardon. For although a Poet soaring in the high region of his fancies with his garland and singing robes about him might without apology speak more of himself then I mean to do, yet for me sitting here below in the cool element of prose, a mortall thing among many readers of no Empyreall conceit, to venture and divulge unusual things of my selfe, I shall petition to the gentler sort, it may not be envy to me. I must say therefore that after I had from my first yeeres by the ceaselesse diligence and care of my father, whom God recompence, bin exercised to the tongues, and some sciences, as my age would suffer, by sundry masters and teachers both at home and at the schools, it was found that whether ought was imposed me by them that had the overlooking, or betak'n to of mine own choise in English, or other tongue prosing or versing, but chiefly this latter, the stile by certain vital fignes it had, was likely to live. But much latelier in the privat Academies of Italy, whither I was favored to resort, perceiving that some trifles which I had in memory, composed at under twenty or thereabout (for the manner is that every one must give some proof of his wit and reading there) met with acceptance above what was lookt for, and other things which I had shifted in scarsity of books and conveniences to patch up amongst them, were received with written Encomiums, which the Italian is not forward to bestow on men of this side the Alps, I began thus farre to assent both to them and divers of my friends here at home, and not lesse to an inward prompting which now grew daily upon me, that by labour and intent study (which I take to be my portion in this life) joyned with the strong propensity of nature, I might perhaps leave something so written to aftertimes, as they should not willingly let it die. These thoughts at once possest me, and these other. That if I were certain to write as men buy Leases, for three lives and downward,

there ought no regard be sooner had, then to Gods glory by the honour and instruction of my country. For which cause, and not only for that I knew it would be hard to arrive at the second rank among the Latines, I applied my selfe to that resolution which Aristo followed against the perswasions of Bembo, to fix all the industry and art I could unite to the adorning of my native tongue; not to make verbal curiosities the end, that were a toylsom vanity, but to be an interpreter & relater of the best and sagest things among mine own Citizens throughout this Iland in the mother dialect. That what the greatest and choycest wits of Athens, Rome, or modern Italy, and those Hebrews of old did for their country, I in my proportion with this over and above of being a Christian, might doe for mine: not caring to be once named abroad, though perhaps I could attaine to that, but content with these British Ilands as my world, whose fortune hath hitherto bin, that if the Athenians, 〈◊〉 some say, made their small deeds great and renowned by their eloquent writers, England hath had her noble atchievments made small by the unskilfull handling of monks and mechanick• . Time serv• not now, and perhaps I might seem too profuse to give any certain account of what the mind at home in the spacious circuits of her musing hath liberty to propose to her self, though of highest hope, and hardest attempting, whether that Epick form whereof the two poems of Homer, and those other two of Virgil and Tasso are a diffuse, and the book of Iob a brief model• or whether the rules of Aristotle herein are strictly to be kept, or nature to be followed, which in them that know art, and use judgement is no transgression, but an inriching of art. And lastly what K or Knight before the conquest might be chosen in whom to lay the pattern of a Christian Heroe. And as Tasso gave to a Prince of Italy his chois whether he would command him to write of Godfreys expedition against the infidels, or Belisarius against the Gothes, or Charlemain against the Lombards; if to the instinct of nature and the imboldning of art ought may be trusted, and that there be nothing advers in our climat, or the fate of this age, it haply would be no rashnesse from an equal diligence and inclination to present the like offer in our own ancient stories. Or whether those Dramatick constitutions, wherein sophocles and Euripides raigne shall be found more doctrinal and exemplary to a Nation, the scripture also affords us a divine pastoral Drama in the song of salomon consisting of two persons and a double Chorus, as Origen rightly judges. 

And the Apocalyps of saint Iohn is the majestick image of a high and stately Tragedy, shutting up and intermingling her solemn scenes and Acts with a sevenfold Chorus of halleluja's and harping symphonies: and this my opinion the grave autority of Pare• 
          commenting that booke is sufficient to confirm. Or if occasion shall lead to imitat those magnifick Odes and Hymns wherein Pin•
           darus and Callimachus are in most things worthy, some others in their frame judicious, in their matter most an end faulty: But those frequent songs throughout the law and prophets beyond all these, not in their divine argument alone, but in the very critical art of composition may be easily made appear over all the kinds of Lyrick poesy, to be incomparable. These abilities, wheresoever they be found, are the inspired guift of Go• rarely bestowed, but yet to some (though most abuse) in every Nation: and are of power beside the office of a pulpit, to inbreed and cherish in a great people the seeds of vertu, and publick civility, to allay the perturbations of the mind, and set the affections in right tune, to celebrate in glorious and lofty Hymns the throne and equipage of Gods Almightinesse, and what he works, and what he suffers to be wrought with high providence in his Church, to sing the victorious agonies of Martyrs and saints, the deeds and triumphs of just and pious Nations doing valiantly through faith against the enemies of Christ, to deplore the general relapses of Kingdoms and states from justice and Gods true worship. Lastly, whatsoever in religion is holy and sublime, in vertu amiable, or grave, whatsoever hath passion or admiration in all the changes of that which is called fortune from without, or the wily suttleties and refluxes of mans thoughts from within, all these things with a solid and treatable smoothnesse to paint out and describe. Teaching over the whole book of sanctity and vertu through all the instances of example with such delight to those especially of soft and delicious temper who will not so much as look upon Truth herselfe, unlesse they see her elegantly drest, that whereas the paths of honesty and good life appear now rugged and difficult, though they be indeed easy and pleasant, they would then appeare to all men both easy and pleasant though they were rugged and difficult indeed. And what a benefit this would be to our youth and gentry, may be soon guest by what we know of the corruption and bane which they suck in dayly from the writings and interludes of libidinous and ignorant Poetasters, who having scars ever heard of that which is the main consistence

of a true poem, the choys of such persons as they ought to introduce, and what is morall and decent to each one, doe for 〈◊〉 most part lap up vitious principles in sweet pils to be swallowed down, and make the tast of vertuous documents harsh and sowr. But because the spirit of man cannot demean it selfe lively in this body without some recreating intermission of labour, and serious things, it were happy for the Common wealth, if our Magistrates, as in those famous governments of old, would take into their care, not only the deciding of our contentious Law cases and brauls, but the managing of our publick sports, and festival pastimes, that they might be, not such as were autorized a while since, the provaction• of drunkennesse and lust, but such as may inure and harden o• bodies by martial exercises to all warlike skil and performance, and may civilize, adom and make discreet our minds by the learned and affable meeting of frequent Academies, and the procurement of wise and artfull recitations sweetned with • oquent and gracefull inticements to the love and practice of justice, temperance and fortitude, instructing and bettering the Nation at all opportunities, that the call of wisdom and vertu may be heard every where, a• 
         salomon saith, she crieth without, she uttereth her voice in the streets, in the top of high places, in the chief concours, and in the openings of the Gates. Whether this may not be not only in Pulpits, but after another persuasive method, at set and solemn Paneguries, in Theaters, porches, or what other place, or way may win most upon the people to receiv at once both recreation, & instruction, let them in autority consult. The thing which I had to say, and those intentions which have lived within me ever since I could conceiv my self any thing worth to my Countrie, I return to crave excuse that urgent reason hath pluckt from me by an abortive and foredated discovery. And the accom• lishment of them lies not but in a power above mans to promise; but that none hath by more studious ways endeavoured, and with more unwearied spirit that none shall, that I dare almost averre of my self, as farre as life and free leasure will extend, and that the Land had once infranchised her self from this impertinent yoke of prelaty, under whose Inquisitorins and tyra• ical duncery no free and splendid wit can flourish. Neither doe I think it shame to covnant with any knowing reader, that for some few yeers yet I may go on trust with him toward the payment of what I am now indebted, as being a work not to be raysed from the heat of youth, or the vapours of wine, like that which

flows at wast from the pen of some vulgar • Word• , or the trencher fury of a riming parasite, nor to be obtained by the invocation of Dame Memory and her siren daughters, but by devout prayer to that eternall spirit who can enrich with all utterance and knowledge, and sends out his seraphim with the hallowed fire of his Altar to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases: to this must be added industrious and select reading, steddy observation, insight into all seemly and generous arts and affaires, till which in some measure be compast, at mine own peril and cost I refuse not to sustain this expectation from as many as are not loath to hazard so much credulity upon the best pledges that I can g• ve them. Although it nothing content me to have disclosed thus much before hand, but that I trust hereby to make it manifest with what small willingnesse I endure to interrupt the pursuit of no lesse hopes then these, and leave a calme and pleasing solitaryn• s fed with cherful and confident thou• hts, to imbark in a troubled sea of noises and hoars disputes, put from beholding the bright countenance of truth in the quiet and still air of delightfull studies to come into the dim reflexion of hollow antiquities sold by the seeming bulk, and there be fain to club quotations with men whose learning and beleif lies in marginal stuffings, who when they have like good sumpter• laid ye down their hors load of citations and fathers at your dore, with a rapsody of who and who were Bishops here or there, ye may take off their packsaddles, their days work is don, and episcopacy, a• they think, stoutly vindicated. Let any gentle apprehension that can distinguish learned pains from unlearned drudgery, imagin what pleasure or profoundnesse can be in this, or what honour to deaf against such adversaries. But were it the meanest under-service, if God by his secretary conscience injoyn it, it were sad for me if I should draw back, for me especially, now when all men offer their aid to help ease and enlighten the difficult labours of the Church, to whose service by the intentions of my parents and friends I was destined of a child, and in mine own resolutions, till comming to some maturity of yeers and perceaving what tyranny had invaded the Church, that he who would take Orders must subscibe slave, and take an oath withall, which unlesse he took with a conscience that would • etch he must either strait perjure, or split his faith, I thought it better to preferre a blamelesse silence before the sacred office of speaking bought, and begun with servitude and forswearing. Howsoever thus Church-outed by the Prelats, hence may appear the

right I have to meddle in these matters, as before, the necessity and constraint appeared. "
"13","CHAP. I. That Prelaty opposeth the reason and end of the Gospel three ways, and first in her outward form. 
         AFter this digression it would remain that I should single o• some other reason which might undertake for Prelaty to be a fit and lawfull Church-government; but finding none of like validity with these that have alredy sped according to their fortune, I shall adde one reason why it is not to be thought a Church-government at all, but a Church-tyranny, and is at hostile terms with the end and reason of Christs Evangelick ministery. Albeit I must confesse to be half in doubt whether I should bring it forth or no, it being so contrary to the eye of the world, and the world so potent in most mens hearts, that I shall endanger either not to be regarded, or not to be understood. For who is ther almost that measures wisdom by simplicity, strength by suffering, dignity by lowlinesse, who is there that counts it first, to be last, somthing to be nothing, and reckons himself of great command in that he is a servant? yet God when he meant to subdue the world and hell a• once, part of that to salvation, and this wholy to perdition, made chois of no other weapons, or auxiliaries then these whether to save, or to destroy. It had bin a small maistery for him, to have drawn out his Legions into array, and flankt them with his thunder; therefore he sent Foolishnes to confute Wisdom, Weaknes to bind strength, Despisednes to vanquish Pride. And this is the great mistery of the Gospel made good in Christ himself, who as he testifies came not to be ministered to, but to minister; and must he fulfiled in all his ministers till his second comming. To goe against these principles s. Paul so feared, that if he should but affect the wisdom of words in his preaching, he thought it would be laid to his charge, that he had made the crosse of Christ to be of none effect Whether then Prelaty do not make of none effect the crosse of Christ by the principles it hath so contrary to these, nullifying the power and end of the Gospel, it shall not want due proof, if it want

not due belief. Neither shal I stand to trifle with one that will tell me of quiddities and formalities, whether Prelaty or Prelateity in abstract notion be this or that, it suffices me that I find it in his • kin, so I find it inseparable, or not oftner otherwise then a Pheni• hath bin seen; although I perswade me that whatever faultines was but superficial to Prelaty at the beginning, is now by the just judgment of God long since branded and inworn into the very essence therof. First therefore, if to doe the work of the Gospel Christ ou• Lord took upon him the form of a servant, how can his servant in this ministery take upon him the form of a Lord? I know Bils• 
          hath deciphered us all the galanteries of signore and Monsignore, and Monsieur as circumstantially as any punctualist of Casteel, Naples, or Fountain Blea• 
          could have don, but this must not so complement us out of our right minds, as to be to learn that the form of a servant was a mean, laborious and vulgar life aptest to teach; which form Christ thought fittest, that he might bring about his will according to his own principles choosing the meaner things of this world that he might put under the high. Now whether the pompous garb, the Lordly life, the wealth, the haughty distance of Prelaty be those meaner things of the world, wherby God in them would manage the mystery of his Gospel, be it the verdit of common sense. For Christ saith in s. Iohn, The servant is not greater then his Lord, nor he that is sent greater then he that sent him. And addes, If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do• them. Then let the prelates well advise, if they neither know, nor do these things, or if they know, and yet doe them not, wherin their happines consists. And thus is the Gospel frustrated by the Lordly form of Prelaty. "
"14","CHAP. II. That the ceremonius doctrin of Prelaty opposeth the reason and end of the Gospel. THat which next declares the heavenly power, and reveales the deep mistery of the Gospel, is the pure simpl• ity of doctrine accounted the foolishnes of this world, yet crossing and confounding the pride and wisdom of the flesh. And wherin consists this

fleshly wisdom and pride? in being altogether ignorant of God and his worship? no surely, for men are naturally ashamed of th• . Where then? it consists in a bold presumption of ordering the worship and service of God after mans own will in traditions and ceremonies. Now if the pride and wisdom of the flesh were to be defeated and confounded, no doubt, but in that very point wherin it was proudest and thought it self wisest, that so the victory of the Gospel might be the more illustrious. But our Prelats instead of expressing the spirituall power of their ministery by warring against this chief bulwark and strong hold of the flesh, have entered into fast league with the principall enemy against whom they were se• , and turned the strength of fleshly pride and wisdom against the pure simplicity of saving truth. First, mistrusting to find the autority of their or• er in the immediat institution of Christ, or his Apostles by the cleer evidence of scripture, they fly to the c• nal supportment of tradition: when we appeal to the Bible, they to the unweildy volumes of tradition. And doe not shame to reject the ordinance of him that is eternal for the pervers iniquity of sixteen hunderd yeers; choosing rather to think truth it self a lyar, the• that sixteen ages should be taxe with an error; not considering the general a postasy that was foretold, and the Churches flight into the wildernes. Nor is this anough, instead of shewing the reason of their lowly condition from divine example and command, they seek to prove their high pre-eminence from humane consent and autority. But let them chaunt while they will of prerogatives, we shall tell them of scripture; of custom, we of scripture; of Acts and statutes, stil of scripture, til the quick and pearcing word enter to the dividing of their soules, & the mighty weaknes of the Gospel throw down the weak mightines of mans reasoning. Now for their demeanor within the Church, how have they disfigured and defac't that more then angelick brightnes, the unclouded serenity of Christian Religion with the dark overcasting of superstitious coaps and flaminical vestures; wearing on their backs; and, I abhorre to think, perhaps in some worse place the unexpressible Image of God the father. Tell me ye Priests wherfore this gold, wherfore these roabs and surplices over the Gospel• is our religion guilty of the first trespasse, and hath need of cloathing to cover her nakednesse? whatdoes this else but hast an ignominy upon the perfection of Christs ministery by seeking to adorn it with that which 〈◊〉 the poor remedy of our • Word• . • eleive it, wondrous Doctors, all

corporeal resemblances of inward holinesse & beauty are now past; he that will cloath the Gospel now, intimates plainly, that the Gospel is naked, uncomely, that I may not say reproachfull. Do not, ye Church maskers, while Christ is cloathing upon our barenes with his righteous garment to make us acceptable in his fathers fight, doe not, as ye do, cover and hide his righteous verity with the polluted cloathing of your ceremonies to make it seem more decent in your own eyes. How beautifull, saith Isaiah, are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth salvation! Are the feet so beautifull, and is the very bringing of these tidings so decent of it self? what new decency then can be added to this by your spinstry? ye think by these gaudy glisterings to stirre up the devotion of the rude multitude; ye think so, because ye forsake the heavenly teaching of s. Paul for the hellish sophistry of Papism. If the multitude be rude, the lips of the Preacher must give knowledge, and not ceremonies. And although some Christians be new born babes comparatively to some that are stronger, yet in respect of ceremony which is but a rudiment of the Law, the weakest Christian hath thrown off the robes of his minority, and is a perfect man, as to legal rites. What childrens food there is in the Gospel we know to be no other then the sincerity of the word that they may grow thereby. But is heer the utmost of your outbraving the service of God? No. Ye have bin bold, not to set your threshold by his threshold, or your posts by his posts, but your sacrament, your • igne, call it what you will, by his sacrament, baptizing the Christian infant with a solemne sprinkle, and unbaptizing for your own part with a profane and impious forefinger: as if when ye had layd the purifying element upon his forehead, ye meant to cancel and crosse it out again with a caracter not of Gods bidding. O but the innocence of these ceremonies! O rather the fottish absurdity of this excuse! what could be more innocent then the washing of a cup, a glasse, or hands before meat, and that under the Law when so many washings were commanded, and by long tradition, yet our saviour detested their customes though never so seeming harmlesse, and charges them severely that they had transgrest the Commandments of God by their traditions and worshipt him in vain. How much more then must these, and much grosser ceremonies now in force delude the end of Christs comming in the flesh against the flesh, and stifle the sincerity of our new cov'nant which hath bound us to forsake all carnall pride and wisdom especially in matters of

religion. Thus we see again how Prelaty sayling in opposition 〈◊〉 the main end and power of the Gospel doth not joyn in that •
         sterious work of Christ, by lowlines to confound height, by simplicity of doctrin the wisdom of the world, but contrariwise hath made it self high in the world and the flesh to vanquish things by the world accounted low, and made it self wise in tradition and fleshly ceremony to confound the purity of doctrin which is the wisdom of God. "
"15","CHAP. III. That Prelatical jurisdiction opposeth the reason and end of the Gospel and of state. THe third and last consideration remains, whether the Prelats in their function doe work according to the Gospel practizing to subdue the mighty things of this world by things weak: which s. Paul hath set forth to be the power and excellence of the Gospel, or whether in more likelihood they band themselves with the prevalent things of this world to overrun the weak things which Christ hath made chois to work by: and this will soonest be discerned by the cours of their jurisdiction. But heer again I find my thoughts almost in suspense betwixt yea and no, and am nigh turning mine eye which way I may best retire, and not proceed in this subject, blaming the ardency of my mind that fixt me too attentively to come thus farre. For Truth, I know not how, hath this unhappinesse fatall to her, ere she can come to the triall and inspection of the Understanding, being to passe through many little wards and limits of the severall Affections and Desires, she cannot shift it, but must put on such colours and attire, as those Pathetick handmaids of the soul please to lead her in to their Queen. And if she find so much favour with them, they let her passe in her own likenesse; if not, they bring her into the presence habited and coloured like a notorious Falshood. And contrary when any Falshood comes that way, if they like the • rrand she brings, they are so artfull to counterfeit the very shape and visage of Truth, that the Understanding not being able to discern the • ucus which these inchantresses with such cunning have laid upon the feature sometimes

of Truth, sometimes of Falshood interchangeably, sentences for the most part one for the other at the first blush, according to the suttle imposture of these sensual mistresses that keep the port• and passages between her and the object. so that were it not for leaving imperfect that which is already said, I should goe neer to relinquish that which is to follow. And because I see that most men, as it happens in this world, either weakly, or falsly principled, what through ignorance, and what through custom of licence, both in discours and writing, by what hath bin of late written in vulgar, have not seemed to attain the decision of this point, I shall likewise assay those wily Arbitresses who in most men have, as was heard, the sole ushering of Truth and Falshood between the sense, and the soul, with what loyalty they will use me in conuoying this Truth to my understanding; the rather for that by as much acquaintance as I can obtain with them, I doe not find them engaged either one way or other. Concerning therfore ecclefial jurisdiction, I find still more controversie, who should administer it, then diligent enquiry made to learn what it is, for had the pains bin taken to search out that, it had bin long agoe enrouled to be nothing el• but a pure tyrannical forgery of the Prelats; and that jurisdictive power in the Church there ought to be none at all. It cannot be conceived that what men now call jurisdiction in the Church, should be other thing then a Christian censorship; and therefore is it most commonly and truly named ecclesiastical censure. Now if the Roman censor a civil function, to that severe assise of survaying and controuling the privatest, and sliest manners of all men and all degrees had no jurisdiction, no courts of plea, or inditement, no punitive force annext, whether it were that to this manner of correction the intanglement of suits was improper, or that the notic• of those upright Inquisitors extended to such the most covert and spiritous vices as would slip easily between the wider and mo• e material grasp of Law; Or that it stood more with the Majesty of that office to have no other serjeants or maces about them but thos• invisible ones of Terror and shame: Or lastly, were it their feare, lest the greatnes of this autority and honour armed with jurisdiction might step with ease into a tyranny. In all these respects with much more reason undoubtedly ought the censure of the Church be quite devested and disintaled of all jurisdiction whatsoever. For if the cours of judicature to a political censorship seem either too t• dions, or too contentions, much more may it to the discipline of

Church whose definitive decrees are to be speedy, but the execution of rigour slow, contrary to what in legal proceedings is mo• usual, and by how much the lesse contentious it is, by so much will it be the more Christian. And if the censor in his morall episcopy being to judge most in matters not answerable by writ or action could not use an instrument so grosse and bodily as jurisdiction is, how can the minister of Gospel manage the corpulent and secular trial of bill and processe in things meerly spiritual. Or could that Roman office without this juridical sword or saw strike such a reverence of it self into the most undaunted hearts, as with one single dash of ignominy to put all the senate and Knighthood of R• 
          into a tremble, surely much rather might the heavenly ministery of the Evangel bind her self about with farre more pearcing beams of Majesty and aw by wanting the beggarly help of halings and amercements in the use of her powerful Keies. For when the Church without temporal support is able to doe her great works upon the unforc't obedience of men, it argues a divinity about her. But when she thinks to credit and better her spirituall efficacy, and to win her self respect and dread by strutting in the fals visard of worldly autority, tis evident that God is not there; but that her apostolick vertu is departed from her, and hath left her Key-cold. Which she perceaving as in a decaied nature seeks to the outward fomentations and chafings of worldly help, and external flourishes, to fetch, if it be possible, some motion into her extream parts, orto hatch a counterseit life with the crafty and arteficial heat of jurisdiction. But it is observable that so long as the Church in tr• e imitat• on of Christ can be content to ride upon an Asse carrying her self and her government along in a mean and simple guise, she may be as he is, a Lion of the tribe of Iuda, and in her humility all men with loud Hosanna's will confesse her greatnes. But when despising the mighty operation of the spirit by the weak things of this world she thinks to make her self bigger and more considerable by using the way of civil force and jurisdiction, as she sits upon this Lion she changes into an Asse, and instead of Hosanna's every man pel• s her with stones and dirt. Lastly, if the wisdom of the Romans feared to commit jurisdiction to an office of so high esteem and d• d as wa• the con• ors, we may see what a solecism in the art of policy it hath bin all this while through Christendom to g• jurisdiction to ecclesiastical Censure. For that strength joyned with religion abused and pretended to ambitions ends must of necessity

breed the heaviest and most quellingty ranny not only upon the necks, but even to the souls of men: which if Christian Rome had bin so cautelous to prevent in her Church, as Pagan Rome was in herstate, we had not had such a lamentable experience thereof as now we have from thenceupon all Christendom. For although I said before that the Church coveting to ride upon the Lionly form of jurisdiction makes a transformation of her self into an Asse, and becomes despicable, that is to those whom God hath enlight'nd with true knowledge; but where they remain yet in the reliques of superstition, this is the extremity of their bondage, and blindnes, that while they think they doe obeisance to the Lordly visage of a Lion, they doe it to an asse, that through the just judgement of God is permitted to play the dragon among them because of their wilfull stupidity. And let England here well rub her eyes, lest by leaving jurisdiction and Church censure to the same persons, now that God hath bin so long medcining her eyesight, she do• not w• her overpolitick fetches marre all, and bring her self back again to worship this Asse bestriding a Lion. Having hit herto explained, that to ecclesiasticall censure no jurisdictive power can be added without a childish and dangerous oversight in polity, and a pernicious contradiction in evangelick discipline, as anon more fully; it will be next to declare wherin the true reason and force of Church censure consists, which by then it shall be laid open to the root, so little is it that I fear lest any crookednes, any wrincle or spo• should be found in presbyterial governnient that if Bodin the famo• French • r though a • apist, yet affirms that the Commonwelth which maintains this discipline will certainly flourish in vertu and piety, I dare assure my self that every true protestant will admire the integrity, the uprightnes, the divine and gracious purposes therof, and even for the reason of it so coherent with the doctrine of the Gospel, besides the evidence of command in scripture, will confesse it to be the only true Church-government, and that contrary to the whole end and m• ry of Christs comming in the flesh a false appearance of the same is exercised by Prelaty. But because some count it rigorous, and that hereby men shall be liable to a double punishment, I will begin somwhat higher and speak of punishment. Which, as i• is an evil, I esteem t• be of two forty, or rather two degrees only, a reprobat conscience in this life, and hell in the other world. Whatever else men • l punishment, or censure is not properly an evil, so it be not an illegall violence, but a saving

med'cin ordained of God both for the publik and privat good 〈◊〉 man, who consisting of two parts the inward and the outward, 〈◊〉 by the eternall providence left under two sorts of cure, the Church and the Magistrat. The Magistrat hath only to deale with the outward part, I mean not of the body alone, but of the mind in all her outward acts, which in scripture is called the outward man. so that it would be helpfull to us if we might borrow such autority 〈◊〉 the Rhetoricians by pa• ent may give us, with a kind of Prometh• skill to shape and fashion this outward man into the similitude 〈◊〉 a body, and set him visible before us; imagining the inner man only as the soul. Thus then the civill Magistrat looking only upon the outward man (I say as a Magistrat, for what he doth further, he doth it as a member of the Church) if he find in his complexion, skin, or outward temperature the signes and marks, or in his doings the effects of injustice, rapine, lost, cruelty, or the like, sometimes he shuts up as in frenetick, or infectious diseases; or confines within dores, as in every sickly estate. sometimes he shaves by penalty, or mulct, or els to cool and take down those luxuriant humors which wealth and excesse have caused to abound. Otherwhiles he ser• , he cauterizes, he scarifies, lets blood, and finally for utmost remedy cuts off. The patients which mostanend are brought into his hospital are such as are farre gon, and beside themselves (unlesse they be falsly accused) so that force is necessary to tame and quiet them 〈◊〉 their unruly fits, before they can be made capable of a more human • ure. His general end is the outward peace and wel-fare of the Commonwealth and civil happines in this life. His p• ular • nd in every man is, by the infliction of pain, dammage, a• disgrace, that the senses and common perceivance might carry this message to the soul within, that it is neither easefull, profitable, nor praisworthy in this life to doe evill. Which must needs tend to the good of man, whether he be to live or die; and be undoubtedly the f• means to a natural man, especially an offender, which might open his eyes to a higher consideration o• good and evill, as it is taught in religion. This is seen in the often penitence of those that suffer, who, had they scapt, had gon on sinning to an immeasurable hea• , which is one of the extreamest punishments. And this is all that the civil Magistrat, as so being, conser• to the healing of mans mind, working only by terrifying 〈◊〉 upon the rind & orifice of the • ore, and by all outward appli• , as the Logicians say, a post• , at the effect, and not from the cause: not once touching th•
         
inward bed of corruption, and that hectick disposition to evill, the sourse of all vice, and obliquity against the rule of Law. Which how insufficient it is to cure the soul of man, we cannot better guesse then by the art of bodily phisick. Therfore God to the intent of further healing mans depraved mind, to this power of the Magistrat which contents it self with the restraint of evil doing in the external man, added that which we call censure, to purge it and remove it clean out of the inmost soul. In the beginning this autority seems to have bin plac't, as all both civil and religious rites once were, only in each father of family. Afterwards among the heathen, in the wise men and Philosophers of the age; but so as it was a thing voluntary, and no set government. More distinctly among the Jews as being Gods peculiar, where the Priests, Levites, Profets, and at last the scribes and Pharises took charge of instructing, and overseeing the lives of the people. But in the Gospel, which is the straitest and the dearest cov'nant can be made between God and man, wee being now his adopted sons, and nothing fitter for us to think on, then to be like him, united to him, and as he pleases to expresse it, to have fellowship with him, it is all necessity that we should expect this blest efficacy of healing our inward man to be ministered to us in a more familiar and effectual method then ever before. God being now no more a judge after the sentence of the Law, nor as it were a school maister of perishable rites, but a most indulgent father governing his Church as a family of sons in their discreet age; and therfore in the sweetest and mildest manner of paternal discipline he hath committed this other office of preserving in healthful constitution the innerman, which may be termed the spirit of the soul, to his spiritual deputy the minister of each Congregation; who being best acquainted with his own flock, h• th best reason to know all the secret• st diseases likely to be, there. And look by how much the inter• 
         • an is more excellant and noble then the external, by so muc• 
         〈◊〉 his cure more exactly, more throughly, and more particularly to be performed. For which cause the holy Ghost by the Apostles joyned to the minister, as assistant in this great office sometimes a certain number of grave and faithful brethren, (for neither doth the phisitian doe all in restoring his patient, he prescribes, another prepares the med'cin, some read, some watch, some visit) much more may a minister partly not see all, partly erre as a man: besides that nothing can be more for the mutuall honour and love of the people to their

Pastor, and his to them, then when in select numb• and cours• they are seen partaking, and doing reverence to the holy 〈◊〉 discipline by their serviceable, and solemn presence, and receiving honour again from their imployment, not now any more to be separated in the Church by vails and partitions as laicks and unclean, but admitted to wait upon the tabernacle as the rightfull Clergy of Christ, a chosen generation, a royal Priesthood to off• up spiritual sacrifice in that meet place to which God and the Congregation shall call and assigne them. And this all Christians ought to know, that the title of Clergy s. Peter gave to all Gods people, till Pope Higinus and the succeeding Prelates took it from them, appropriating that name to themselves and their Priests only; and condemning the rest of Gods inheritance to an injurious and alienat condition of Laity, they separated from them by local partitions in Churches, through their gr• sse ignorance and pride imitating the old temple: and excluded the members of Christ from the property of being members, the bearing of orderly and fit offices in the ecclesiastical body, as if they had meant to sow up that Iewish vail which Christ by his death on the Crosse rent in sunder. Although these usurpers could not so: presently over-maister the liberties and lawfull titles of Gods freeborn Church, but that Origen being yet a lay man expounded the scriptures publickly, and was therein defended by Alexander of Jerusalem, and Theoctistus of Caesarea producing in his behalf divers examples that the privilege of teaching was anciently permitted to many worthy Laymen; And Cyprian in his Epistles professes he will doe nothing without the advice and assent of his assistant Laicks. Neither did the first Nicene councel, as great and learned as it was, think it any robbery to receive in, and require the help and presence of many learned lay brethren, as they were then calld. Many other autorities to confirm this assertion bot• 
         〈◊〉 of scripture and the writings of next antiquity Golartius hath collected in his notes upon Cyprian; whereby it will be evident that the Laity not only by Apostolick permission, but by consent of many the aucientest Prelates did participat in Church offices as much as is desired any lay Elder should now do. sometimes also not the Elders alone, but the whole body of the Church is interested in the work of discipline, as 〈◊〉 as publick satisfaction is given by those that have given publick scandal. Not to speak now of her right in elections. But another reason there is in it, which though religion did not commend to us, yet morall

and civil prudence could not but extol. It was thought of old in Philosophy, that shame or to call it better, the reverence of our elders, our brethren, and friends was the greatest incitement to vertuous deeds and the greatest dissuasion from unworthy attempts that might • Word• . Hence we may read in the Iliad where Hector being wisht to retire si ō the battel, many of his forces being routed, makes answer that he durst not for shame, lest the Trojan Knights and Dames should think he did ignobly. And certain it is that wheras Terror is thought such a great stickler in a Commonwealth, honourable shame is a farre greater, and has more reason• For where shame is there is fear, but where fear is there is not presently shame. And if any thing may be done to inbreed in us this generous and Christianly reverence one of another, the very Nurs and Guardian of piety and vertue, it can not sooner be then by such a discipline in the Church, as may use us to have in aw the assemblies of the faithful, & to count it a thing most grievous, next to the grieving of Gods spirit, to offend those whom he hath put in autority, as a healing superintendence over our lives and behaviours, both to our own happines and that we may not give offence to good men, who without amends by us made, dare not against Gods command hold communion with us in holy things. And this will be accompanied with a religious dred of being outcast from the company of saints, and from the fatherly protection of God in his Church, to consort with the devil and his angels. But there is yet a more ingenuous and noble degree of honest shame, or call it if you will an esteem, whereby men bear an inward reverence toward their own persons. And if the love of God as a fire sent from Heaven to be ever kept alive upon the altar of our hearts, be the first principle of all godly and vertuous actions in men, this pious and just honouring of our selves is the second, and may be thought as the radical moisture and fountain head, whence every laudable and worthy enterpri• issues forth. And although I have giv'n it the name of a liquid thing, yet is it not incontinent to bound it self, as humid things are, but hath in it a most restraining and powerfull abstinence to start back, and glob it self upward from the mixture of any ungenerous and unbeseeming motion, or any soile • ewith it may peril to stain it self. something I confesse it is to • ed of evil doing in the presence of any, and to reverence the opinion and the countenance of a good man rather then a bad, fearing most in his • ght to offend, goes so farre as almost to be vertuous; yet this is but still the feare

of infamy, and many such, when they find themselves alone, 〈◊〉 their reputation will compound with other scruples, and co• close treaty with their dearer vices in secret. But he that holds himself in reverence and due esteem, both for the dignity of Gods 〈◊〉 upon him, and for the price of his redemption, whi• he thin• 
         〈◊〉 visibly markt upon his forehead, accounts himselfe both a fit person to do the noblest and godliest deeds, and much better worth then to deject and defile, with such a debasement and such a pollution as sin is, himselfe so highly ransomed and enobled to a new friendship and filiall relation with God. Nor can he fear so much the offence and reproach of others, as he dreads and would 〈◊〉 at the reflection of his own severe and modest eye upon him• , if it should see him doing or imagining that which is sinfull though in the deepest secrecy. How shall a man know to do himselfe this right, how to performe this honourable duty of estimation and respect towards his own soul and body? which way will leade 〈◊〉 best to this hill top of sanctity and goodness• above which there is no higher ascent but to the love of God which from this self-pious regard cannot be assunder? no better way doubtlesse then to let him duly understand that as he is called by the high calling of God to be holy and pure, so is he by the same appointment ordained, and by the Churches call admitted to such offices of discipline in the Church to which his owne spirituall gifts by the example of Apostolick institution have autorized him. For we have learnt that the scornfull terme of Laick, the consecrating of Temples, carpets, and table-clothes, • he railing in of a repugnant and contradictive Mount sinai in the Gospell, as if the touch of a lay Christian who is never the lesse Gods living temple, could profane dead judaisms, the exclusion of Christs people from the offices of holy discipline through the pride of a usurping Clergy, causes the rest to have an unworthy and object opinion of themselves; to approach to holy, duties with a slavish fear, • nd to unholy doings with a familiar • ldnesse. For seeing such a wide and terrible distance between religious things and themselves, and that in respect of a woodden table & the perimeter of holy ground about it, a flagon pot, and 〈◊〉 corporal, the Priest 〈◊〉 their lay-ships unhallowed and • Word• , they fear religion with such a fear as loves not, and think the p• rity of the Gospell too pure for them, and that any uncleannesse is more sutable to their 〈◊〉 estate. But when every good Christian throughly acquainted

with all those glorious privileges of sanctification and adoption which render him more sacred then any dedicated altar or element, shall be restored to his right in the Church, and not excluded from such place of spirituall government as his Christian abilities and his approved good life in the eye and testimony of the Church shall preferre him to, this and nothing sooner will open his eyes to a wise and true valuation of himselfe, which is so requisite and high a point of Christianity, and will stirre him up to walk worthy the honourable and grave imployment wherewith God and the Church hath dignified him: not fearing left he should meet with some outward holy thing in religion which his lay touch or presence might profane, but lest something unholy from within his own heart should dishonour and profane in himselfe that Priestly unction and Clergy-right whereto Christ hath entitled him. Then would the congregation of the Lord soone recover the true likenesse and visage of what she is indeed, a holy generation, a royall Priesthood, a saintly communion, the houshold and City of God. And this I hold to be another considerable reason why the functions of Church-government ought to be free and open to any Christian man though never so laick, if his capacity, his faith, and prudent demeanour commend him. And this the Apostles warrant us to do. But the Prelats object that this will bring profanenesse into the Church, to whom may be replied, that none have brought that in more then their own irreligious courses; nor more 〈◊〉 holinesse out of living into livelesse things. For whereas God who hath cleansed every beast and creeping worme, would not suffer s. Peter to call them common or unclean, the Prelat Bishops in their printed orders hung up in Churches have proclaimed the best of creatures, mankind, so unpurified and contagious, that for him to lay his hat, or his garment upon the Chancell table they have defined it no lesse hainous in expresse words then to profane the Table of the Lord. And thus have they by their Canaanitish doctrine (for that which was to th• Jew but jewish is to the Christian no better then Canaanitish) thus have they made common and unclean, thus have they made profane that nature which God hath not only cleansed, but Christ also hath assumed. And now that the equity and just reason is so perspicuous, why in Ecclesiasic• censure the assistance should be added of such, 〈◊〉 whom not the vile odour of gaine and fees (forbid it God and blow it with a whirle
         • out of our land) but charity, neighbourhood, and duty to Church-government hath called together, where could a wiseman

wish a more equall, gratuitous, and meek examination of 〈◊〉 offence that he might happen to commit against Christianity 〈◊〉 here? would he preferre those proud simoniacall Courts? 〈◊〉 therefore the Minister assisted attends his heavenly and spirituall cure. Where we shall see him both in the course of his proceeding, and first in the excellence of his end from the magistrate farre different, and not more different then excelling. His end is to recover all that is of man both soul and body to an everlasting health: and yet as for worldly happinesse, which is the proper sphere wherein the magistrate cannot but confine his motion without a hideous exorbitancy from law, so little aims the Minister, as his intended scope, to procure the much prosperity of this life, that oft-times he may have cause to wish much of it away, a• a diet puffing up the soul with a slimy fleshinesse, and weakning her principall organick parts. Two heads of evill he has to cope with, ignorance and malice. Against the former he provides the daily Manna of incorruptible doctrine, not at those set meales only in publick, but as oft as he shall know that each infirmity, or constitution requires. Against the latter with all the branches thereof, not medling with that restraining and styptick surgery which tho law uses, not indeed against the malady but against the eruptions, and outermost effects thereof. He on the contrary beginning at the prime causes and roo• of the disease sends in those two divine ingredients of most cleansing power to the soul, Admonition & Reproof, besides which two there is no drug or antidote that can reach to purge the mind, and without which all other experiments are but vain, unlesse by •
         dent. And he that will not let these passe into him, though he be the greatest King, as Plato affirms, must be thought to remaine impure within, and unknowing of those things wherein his purenesse and his knowledge should most appear. As soon therefore as it may be discerned that the Christian patient by feeding 〈◊〉 here on meats not allowable, but of evill juice, hath disordered his diet, and spread an ill humour through his 〈◊〉 immediatly disposing to a sicknesse, the minister as being much neerer both in eye and duty, then the magistrats, speeds him betimes to overtake that diffused malignance with some gentle potion of admonishment; or if ought be obstructed, puts in his opening and disenssive con• . This not succeeding after once or twice or oftner, in the 〈◊〉 of two or three his faithfull brethren appointed thereto be advis• him to be more carefull of his dearest health, and what it is that he

so rashly hath let down in to the divine vessel of his soul Gods temple. If this obtaine not, he then with the counsell of more assistants who are informed of what diligence hath been already used, with more speedy remedies layes neerer siege to the entrenched causes of his distemper, not sparing such servent and well aimed reproofs as may best give him to see the dangerous estate wherein he is. To this also his brethren and friends intreat, exhort, adjure, and all these endeavours, as there is hope left, are more or lesse repeated. But if, neither the regard of himselfe, nor the reverence of his Elders and friends prevaile with him, to leave his vitious appetite, then as the time urges, such engines of terror God hath given into the hand of his minister as to search the tenderest angles of the heart: one while he shakes his stubbornnesse with racking convulsions nigh dispaire, other whiles with deadly corrosives he gripes the very roots of his faulty liver to bring him to life through the entry of death. Hereto the whole Church beseech him, beg of him, deplore him, pray for him. After all this performed with what patience and attendance is possible, and no relenting on his part, having done the utmost of their cure, in the name of God and of the Church they dissolve their fellowship with him, and holding forth the dreadfull sponge of excommunion pronounce him wip't out of the list of Gods inheritance, and in the custody of satan till he repent. Which horrid sentence though it touch neither life, nor limme, nor any worldly possession, yet has it such a penetrating force, that swifter then any chimicall sulphur, or that lightning which harms not the skin, and rifles the entrals, it scorches the inmost soul. Yet even this terrible denouncement is left to the Church for no other cause but to be as a rough and vehement cleansing medcin, where the malady is obdurat; a mortifying to life, a kind of saving by undoing. And it may be truly said, that as the mercies of wicked men are cruelties, so the cruelties of the Church are mercies. For if repentance sent from heaven meet this lost wanderer, and draw him out of that steep journey wherein he was hasting towards destruction, to come and reconcile to the Church, if he bring with him his bill of health, and that he is now cleare of infection and of no danger to the other sheep, then with incredible expressions of joy all his brethren receive him, and set before him those perfumed bankets of Christian consolation; with pretious ointments bathing and somenting the old and now to be forgotten stripes which terror and shame had inflicted; and thus with heavenly solaces they cheere up

his humble remorse, till he regain his first health and felicity. This is the approved way which the Gospell prescribes, these are the spirituall weapons of holy censure, and ministeriall warfare, not carnall, but mighty through God to the pulling downe of strong holds, casting 
         Cor. 2. 10. 
         down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it selfe against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. What could be done more for the healing and reclaming that divine particle of Gods breathing the soul, and what could be done lesse? he that would hide his faults from such a wholsome curing as this, and count it a two-fold punishment; as some do, is like a man that having foul diseases about him, perishes for shame, and the fear he has o• a rigorous incision to come upon hi• flesh. We shall be able by this time to discern whether Prelaticall jurisdiction be contrary to the Gospell or no. First therefore the government of the Gospell being economicall and paternall, that is, of such a family where there be no servants, but all sons in obedience, not in servility, as cannot be denied by him that lives but within the sound of scripture, how can the Prelates justifie to have turned the fatherly orders of Christs houshold, the blessed meeknesse of his lowly roof, those ever open and inviting dores of his dwelling house which delight to be frequented with only filiall accesses, how can they justifie to have turned these domestick privileges into the barre of a proud judiciall court where fees and clamours keep shop and drive a trade, w• ere bribery and corruption solicits, paltring the free and monilesse power of discipline with a carnall satisfaction by the purse. Contrition, humiliation, confession, the very sighs of a repentant spirit are there sold by the penny. That undefloured and unblemishable simplicity of the Gospell, not she her selfe for that could never be, but a false-whi• ed, a lawnie resemblance of her, like that aire-born Helena in the fables, made by the sorcery of Prelats, instead of calling her Disciples from the receit of custome, is now turned Publican her self; and gives up her body to a mercenary whor• ome under those fornicated ches which she cals Gods house, and in the fight of those her altars which she hath set up to be adored makes merchandize of the bodies and souls of men. Rejecting purgatory for no other reason, as it seems, then because her greedines cannot deferre • ut had rather use the utmost extortion of redeemed penances in this life. But because these matters could not be thus carried without a begged and borrowed force from worldly autority, therefore prelaty slighting

the deliberat• d chosen counsell of Christ in his spirituall government, whose glory is in the weaknesse of fleshly things to t• ad upon the crest of the worlds pride and violence by the power of spirituall ordinances, hath on the contrary made these her freinds and champions which are Christs enemies in this his high designe, smothering and extinguishing the spirituall force of his bodily weaknesse in the discipline of his Church with the boistrous and carnall tyranny of an undue, unlawfull and ungospellike jurisdiction. And thus Prelaty both in her fleshly supportments, in her carnall doctrine of ceremonie and tradition, in her violent and secular power going quite counter to the prime end of Christs comming in the flesh, that is to revele his truth, his glory and his might in a clean contrary manner then Prelaty seeks to do, thwarting and defeating the great mistery of God, I do not conclude that Prelaty is Antichristian, for what need I? the things themselves conclude it. Yet if such like practises, and not many worse then these of our Prelats, in that great darknesse of the Roman Church, have not exempted both her and her present members from being judged to be Antichristian in all orthodoxall esteeme, I cannot think but that it is the absolute voice of truth and all her children to pronounce this Prelaty, and these her dark deeds in the midst of this great light wherein we live, to be more Antichristian then Antichrist himselfe. "
"16","The Conclusion. The mischiefe that Prelaty does in the state. I Adde one thing more to those great ones that are so fond of Prelaty, this is certain that the Gospell being the hidden might of Christ, as hath been heard, hath over a victorious power joyned with it, like him in the Revelation that went forth on the white Horse with his bow and his crown conquering, and to conquer. If we let the Angell of the Gospell ride on his own way, he does his proper businesse conquering the high thoughts, and the proud reasonings of the flesh, and brings them under to give obedience to Christ with the salvation of many souls. But if ye turn him out of his rode, and in a manner force him to expresse his irresistible power

by a doctrine of carnall might, as Prelaty is, 〈◊〉 will use th• , fleshly strength which ye put into his hands to subdue your spirits by a servile and blind superstition, and that againe shall hold such dominion over your captive minds, as returning with an insatiat greedinesse and force upon your worldly wealth and power wherewith to deck and magnifie her self, and her false worships, she shall spoil and havock your estates, disturbe your ease, diminish your honour, inthraul your liberty under the swelling mood of a proud Clergy, who will not serve or feed your soules with spirituall food, look not for it, they have not wherewithall, or if they had, it is not in their purpose. But when they have glutted their ingratefull bodies, at least if it be possible that those open sepulchers should ever be glutted, and when they have stufft their Idolish temples with the wastefull pillage of your estates, will they yet have any compassion upon you, and that poore pittance which they have left you, will they be but so good to you as that ravisher was to his sister, when he had used her at his pleasure, will they but only hate ye and so turne ye loose? no• they will not, Lords and Commons, they will not fauour ye so much. What will they do then in the name of God and saints, what will these man-haters yet with more despight and mischiefe do? Ile tell ye, or at least remember ye, for most of ye know it already. That they may want nothing to make them true merchants of Babylon, as they have done to your souls, they will sell your bodies, your wives, your children, your liberties, your parliaments, all these things, and if there be ought else dearer then these, they will sell at an out-cry in their Pulpits to the arbitrary and illegall dispose of any one that may hereafter be called a King, whose mind shall serve him to listen to their bargain. And by their corrupt and servile doctrines boring our eares to an everlasting slavery, as they have done hitherto, so will they yet do their best to repeal and erase every line and clause of both our great charter• . No• is this only what they will doe, but what they hold as the main• reason and mystery of their advancement that they must do; • e the Prince never so just and equall to his subjects; yet such are their malicious and depraved eyes, that they so look on him, & so understand him, as if he required no other gratitude, or piece of service si• thē then this. And indeed they stand so opportunly for the disturbing or the destroying of a state, being a knot of creatures whose dignities, means, and preferments have no foundation in the Gospel, as they themselves acknowledge, but only in the Princes favour, & to

continue so long to them, as by pleasing him they shall deserve, whence it must needs be they should bend all their intentions, and services to no other ends but to his, that if it should happen that a tyrant (God turn such a scourge from us to our enemies) should come to grasp the scepter, here were his speare men and his lances, here were his firelocks ready, he should need no other pretorian band nor pensionry then these, if they could once with their perfidious preachments aw the people. For although the Prelats in time of popery were sometimes friendly anough to magnacharta, it was because they stood upon their own bottom, without their main dependance on the royal nod: but now being well acquainted that the protestant religion, if she will reform her self rightly by the scriptures, must undresse them of all their guilded vanities, and reduce them as they were at first, to the lowly and equall order of Presbyters, they know it concerns them neerly to study the times more then the text, and to lift up their eyes to the hils of the Court, from whence only comes their help; but if their pride grow weary of this crouching and observance, as ere long it would, and that yet their minds clime still to a higher ascent of worldly honour, this only refuge can remain to them, that they must of necessity contrive to bring themselves and us back again to the Popes supremacy, and this we see they had by fair degrees of late been doing. These be the two fair supporters between which the strength of Prelaty is born up, either of inducing tyranny, or of reducing popery. Hence also we may judge that Prelaty is meer falshood. For the property of Truth is, where she is publickly taught, to unyoke & set free the minds and spirits of a Nation first from the thraldom of sin and superstition, after which all honest and legal freedom of civil life cannot be long absent; but Prelaty whom the tyrant custom begot a natural tyrant in religion, & in state the agent & minister of tyranny, seems to have had this fatal guift in her nativity like another Midas that whatsoever she should touch or come ne• r either in ecclesial or political government, it should turn, not to gold, though she for her part could wish it, but to the drosse and scum of slavery breeding and setling both in the bodies and the souls of all such as doe not in time with the sovran tr• le of sound doctrine provide to fortifie their hearts against her Hierarchy. The service of God who is Truth, her Liturgy confesses to be perfect freedom, but her works and her opinions declare that the service of Prelaty is p• rfect slavery, and by consequence perfect falshood. Which makes me wonder much that many of the Gentry, studious men, as I heare

should engage themselves to write, and speak 〈◊〉 in her •
        fence, but that I beleeve their honest and ingenuous natures coming to the Universities to store themselves with good and solid learning, and there unfortunately fed with nothing else, but the s• gged and thorny lectures of monkish and miserable sophistry, w• re sent home again with such a scholastical burre in their throats, as hath stopt and hinderd all true and generous philosophy from entring, crackt their voices for ever with metaphysical gargarisms, and hath made them admire a sort of formal outside men prelatically addicted, whose unchast'nd and unwrought minds never yet initiated or subdued under the true lore of religion or moral vertue, which two are the best and greatest points of learning, but either slightly trained up in a kind of hypocritical and hackny cours of literature to get their living by, and dazle the ignorant, or els fondly overstudied in uselesse cōtroversies, except those which they use with all the specious and delusive suttlety they are able, to defend their prelatical sparta, having a Gospel and Church-government set before their eyes, as a fair field wherin they might exercise the greatest vertu's, and the greatest deeds of Christian autority in mean fortunes and little furniture of this world, which even the sage heathen writers and those old Fabritii, and Curii well knew to be a manner of working, then which nothing could lik'n a mortal man more to God, who delights most to worke from within himself, and not by the heavy luggage of corporeal instrument, they understand it not, & think no such matter, but admire & dote upon worldly riches, & honours, with an easie & intemperat life, to the bane of Christianity: yea they and their seminaries shame not to professe, to petition and never lin pealing our eares that unlesse we fat them like boores, and cramme them as they list with wealth, with Deaneries, and pluralities, with Baronies and stately preferments, all learning and religion will goe underfoot. Which is such a shamelesse, such a bestial plea, and of that odious impudence in Church-men, who should be to • is a pattern of temperance and frugal mediocrity, who should teach us to contemn this world, and the gaudy things thereof, according to the promise which they themselves require from us in baptisme, that should the scripture stand by and be mute, there is not that sect of Philosophers among the heathen so dissolute, no not Epicurus, nor Aristippus with all his Cyrenaick rout, but would shut his school dores against such greasy sophisters: not any College of Mountebanks, but would

think scorn to discover in themselves with such a brazen forehead the outrageous desire of filthy lucre. Which the Prelats make so little conscience of, that they are ready to fight, and if it lay in their power, to massacre all good Christians under the names of horrible schismaticks for only finding fault with their temporal dignities, their unconscionable wealth and revenues, their cruell autority over their brethren that labour in the word, while they sno• in their luxurious excesse. Openly proclaming themselvs now in the sight of all men to be those which for a while they fought to cover under sheeps cloathing, ravenous and savage wolves threatning inrodes and bloody incursions upon the flock of Christ, which they took upon them to feed, but now clame to devour us their prey. More like that huge dragon of Egypt breathing out wast, and desolation to the land, unlesse he were daily fatned with virgins blood. Him our old patron saint George by his matchlesse valour slew, as the Prelat of the Garter that reads his Collect • an tell. And if our Princes and Knights will imitate the same of th• t old champion, as by their order of Knighthood solemnly taken, they vow, farre be it that they should uphold and side with this English Dragon; but rather to doe as indeed their oath binds them, they should make it their Knightly adventure to pursue & vanquish this mighty sailewinged monster that menaces to swallow up the Land, unlesse her bottomlesse gorge may be satisfied with the blood of the Kings daughter the Church; and may, as she was wont, fill her dark and infamous den with the bones of the saints. Nor will any one have reason to think this as too incredible or too tragical to be spok'n of Prelaty, if he consider well from what a masse of slime and mud, the sloathful, the covetous and ambitious hopes of Church-promotions and fat Bishopricks she is bred up and nuzzled in, like a great Python from her youth, to prove the general poyson both of doctrine and good discipline in the Land. For certainly such hopes and such principles of earth as these wherein she welters from a yong one, are the immediat generation both of a slavish and tyranous life to follow, and a p• stiferous contagion to the whole Kingdom, till like that fenborn serpent she be shot to death with the darts of the sun, the pure and powerful beams of Gods word. And this may serve to describe to us in part, what Prelaty hath bin and what, if she stand, she is like to be toward the whole body of people in England. Now that it may appeare how she is not such a kind of evil, a• hath any good, or use in it, which many evils have, but a

distilled quintessence, a pure elixar of mischief, pestilent alike to a• I shal shew briefly, ere I conclude, that the Prelats, as they are to the subjects a calamity, so are they the greatest underminers and betrayers of the Monarch, to whom they seem to be most favourable. I cannot better liken the state and person of a King then to that mighty Nazarite samson; who being disciplined from his birth in the precepts and the practice of Temperance and sobriety, without the strong drink of injurious and excessive desires, grows up to a noble strength and perfection with those his illustrious and sunny locks the laws waving and curling about his god like shoulders. And while he keeps them about him undiminisht and unshorn, he may with the jaw-bone of an Asse, that i• , with the word of his meanest officer suppresse and put to confusion thousands of those that rise against his just power. But laying down his head among the strumpet flatteries of Prelats, while he sleeps and thinks no harme, they wickedly shaving off all those bright and waighty tresses of his laws, and just prerogatives which were his ornament and strength, deliver him over to indirect and violent councels, which as those Philistims put out the fair, and farre-sighted eyes of his natural discerning, and make him grinde in the prison house of their sinister ends and practices upon him. Till he knowing this prelatical rasor to have bereft him of his wonted might, nourish again his puissant hair, the golden beames of Law and Right; and they sternly shook, thunder with ruin upon the heads of those his evil counsellors, but not without great affliction to himselfe. This is the sum of their loyal service to Kings; yet these are the men that stil cry the King, the King, the Lords Anointed. We grant it, and wonder how they came to light upon any thing so true; and wonder more, if Kings be the Lords Anointed, how they dare thus oyle over and bes• eare so holy an unction with the corrupt and putrid oyntment of their base flatteries, which while they smooth the skin, strike inward and envenom the life blood. What fidelity Kings can expect from Prelats both examples past, and our present experience of their doings at this day, whereon is grounded all that hath bin said, may suffice to inform us. And if they be such clippers of regal power and shavers of the Laws, how they stand affected to the law giving parliament, your selves, worthy Peeres and Commons, can best testifie; the current of whose glorious and immortal actions hath bin only opposed by the obscure and pernicious defignes of the Prelats: until: their insolen•
        
broke out to such a bold affront, as hath justly immured their haughty looks within strong wals. Nor have they done any thing of late with more diligence; then to hinder or break the happy assembling of parliaments, however needfull to repaire the shattered and disjoynted frame of the commonwealth, or if they cannot do this, to crosse, to disinable, and traduce all parliamentary proceedings. And this, if nothing else, plainly accuses them to be no lawful members of the house, if they thus perpetually mutine against their own body. And though they pretend like salomons harlot, that they have right thereto, by the same judgement that salomon gave, it cannot belong to them, whenas it is not onely their assent, but their endeavour continually to divide parliaments in twain; and not only by dividing, but by all other means to abolish and destroy the free use of them to all posterity. For the which and for all their former misdeeds, wherof this book and many volumes more cannot contain the moytie, I shal move yee Lords in the behalf I dare say of many thousand good Christians, to let your justice and speedy sentence passe against this great malefactor Prelaty. And yet in the midst of rigor I would beseech ye to think of mercy; and such a mercy, I feare I shal overshoot with a desire to save this falling Prelaty, such a mercy (if I may venture to say • Word• ) a• may exceed that which for only ten righteous persons would have saved sodom. Not that I dare advise ye to contend with God whether he or you shal be more merciful, but in your wise esteems to ballance the offences of those peccant Citties with these enormous riots of ungodly mis-rule that Prelaty hath wrought both in the Church of Christ, and in the state of this Kingdome. And if ye think ye may with a pious presumption strive to goe beyond God in mercy, I shall not be one now that would dissuade ye. Though God for lesse then ten just persons would not spare sodom, yet if you can finde after due search but only one good thing in prelaty either to religion• or civil govern• to King or Parliament 〈◊〉 Prince or people, to law, liberty, 〈◊〉 learning, spare her, 〈◊〉 her live, let her spread among ye, till with her shadow, all your dignities and honours, and all the glory of the land be darkened and obscurd. But on the contrary if she be found to be malignant, hostile, destructive to all these, as nothing can be surer, then let your severe and impartial doom imitate the divine vengeance; rain down your punishing force upon this godlesse and oppressing government: and bring such a dead sea of subversion upon her, that she may never in this Land rise more to afflict the holy reformed Church, and the elect people of God. The end. "
