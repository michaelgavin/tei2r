            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Written by Mr.</hi> Dryden, <hi>to a New Play, call'd,</hi> The Loyal Brother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </byline>
            <l>POets, like Lawfull Monarchs, rul'd the Stage,</l>
            <l>Till Criticks, like Damn'd Whiggs, debauch'd our Age.</l>
            <l>Mark how they jump: Criticks wou'd regulate</l>
            <l>Our Theatres, and Whiggs reform our State:</l>
            <l>Both pretend love, and both (Plague rot 'em) hate.</l>
            <l>The Critick humbly <U+017F>eems Advice to bring,</l>
            <l>The fawning Whigg Petitions to the King:</l>
            <l>But ones advice into a Satyr <U+017F>lides;</l>
            <l>T'others Petition a Remon<U+017F>trance hides.</l>
            <l>The<U+017F>e will no Taxes give, and tho<U+017F>e no Pence:</l>
            <l>Criticks wou'd <U+017F>tarve the Poet, Whiggs the Prince.</l>
            <l>The Critick all our troops of friends di<U+017F>cards;</l>
            <l>Ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>o the Whigg wou'd fain pull down the Guards.</l>
            <l>Guards are illegal, that drive foes away,</l>
            <l>As watchfull Shepherds, that fright bea<U+017F>ts of prey.</l>
            <l>Kings, who Disband <U+017F>uch needle<U+017F>s Aids as the<U+017F>e,</l>
            <l>Are <U+017F>afeâ€”as long as e're their Subjects plea<U+017F>e.</l>
            <l>And that wou'd be till next Queen <hi>Be<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> night:</l>
            <l>Which thus, grave penny Chroniclers endite.</l>
            <l>Sir <hi>Edmond-berry,</hi> fir<U+017F>t, in wofull wi<U+017F>e,</l>
            <l>Leads up the <U+017F>how, and Milks their Maudlin eyes.</l>
            <l>There's not a Butcher's Wife but Dribs her part,</l>
            <l>And pities the poor Pageant from her heart;</l>
            <l>Who, to provoke revenge, rides round the fire,</l>
            <l>And, with a civil congee, does retire.</l>
            <l>But guiltle<U+017F>s blood to ground mu<U+017F>t never fall:</l>
            <l>There's <hi>Antichri<U+017F>t</hi> behind, to pay for all.</l>
            <l>The Punk of <hi>Babylon</hi> in Pomp appears,</l>
            <l>A lewd Old Gentleman of Seventy years.</l>
            <l>Who<U+017F>e Age in vain our Mercy wou'd implore;</l>
            <l>For few take pity on an Old-ca<U+017F>t Whore.</l>
            <l>The Devil, who brought him to the <U+017F>hame, takes part;</l>
            <l>Sits cheek by jowl, in black, to cheer his heart:</l>
            <l>Like Theef and Par<U+017F>on in a <hi>Tyburn-Cart.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The word is giv'n; and with a loud Huzzaw</l>
            <l>The Miter'd Moppet from his Chair they draw:</l>
            <l>On the <U+017F>lain Corps contending Nations fall;</l>
            <l>Alas, what's one poor Pope among 'em all!</l>
            <l>He burns; now all true hearts your Triumphs ring;</l>
            <l>And next (for fa<U+017F>hion) cry, <hi>God <U+017F>ave the King.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>A needful Cry in mid<U+017F>t of <U+017F>uch Alarms:</l>
            <l>When Forty thou<U+017F>and Men are up in Arms.</l>
            <l>But after he's once <U+017F>av'd, to make amends,</l>
            <l>In each <U+017F>ucceeding Health they Damn his Friends:</l>
            <l>So God begins, but <U+017F>till the Devil ends.</l>
            <l>What if <U+017F>ome one in<U+017F>pir'd with Zeal, <U+017F>hou'd call<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
            </l>
            <l>Come let's go cry, God <U+017F>ave him at <hi>White Hall?</hi>

His be<U+017F>t friends wou'd not like this over-care:</l>

            <l>Five Praying Saints are by an Act allow'd:</l>

            <l>He's neither yet a Whigg nor Tory-Boy;</l>
            <l>But, like a Girl, whom <U+017F>everal wou'd enjoy,</l>
            <l>Begs leave to make the be<U+017F>t of his own natural Toy.</l>
