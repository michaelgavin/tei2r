            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>EPISTLE To the WHIGS.</head>
            <p>FOR to whom can I dedicate this Poem, with <U+017F>o much ju<U+017F>tice as to you? 'Tis the repre<U+017F>entation of your own Heroe: 'tis the Picture drawen at length, which you admire and prize <U+017F>o much in little. None of your Ornaments are wanting; neither the Land<U+017F>cap of the Tower, nor the Ri<U+017F>ing Sun; nor the <hi>Anno Domini</hi> of your New Soveraign's Goronation. This mu<U+017F>t needs be a gratefull undertaking to your whole Party: e<U+017F>pecially to tho<U+017F>e who have not been <U+017F>o happy as to purcha<U+017F>e the Original. I hear the <hi>Graver</hi> has made a good Market of it: all his Kings are bought up already; or the value of the remainder <U+017F>o inhanc'd, that many a poor <hi>Polander</hi> who would be glad to wor<U+017F>hip the Image, is not able to go to the co<U+017F>t of him: But mu<U+017F>t be content to <U+017F>ee him here. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s I am no great Arti<U+017F>t; but Sign-po<U+017F>t painting will <U+017F>erve the turn to remember a Friend by; e<U+017F>pecially when better is not to be had. Yet for your comfort the lineaments are true: and though he <U+017F>ate not five times to me, as he did to <hi>B.</hi> yet I have con<U+017F>ulted Hi<U+017F>tory; as <hi>Italian</hi> Painters do, when they wou'd draw a <hi>Nero</hi> or a <hi>Caligula;</hi> though they have not <U+017F>een the Man; they can help their Imagination by a Statue of him, and find out the Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>S<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>onius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus.</hi> Truth is, you might have <U+017F>par'd one <U+017F>ide of your Medall: the Head wou'd be <U+017F>een to more advantage, if it were plac'd on a Spike of the Tower; a little nearer to the Sun.
<pb facs="tcp:44131:3"/>
Which wou'd then break out to better purpo<U+017F>e. You tell us in your Preface to the <hi>No-prote<U+017F>tant Plot,</hi> that you <U+017F>hall be forc'd hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to leave off your Mode<U+017F>tie: I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e you mean that little which is left you: for it was morn to rags when you put out this Medall. Never was there practis'd <U+017F>uch a piece of notorious Impudence in the face of an E<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h'd Government. <hi>I</hi> believe, when he is dead, you will wear him in Thumb-Rings, as the <hi>Turks</hi> did <hi>Scanderbeg;</hi> as if there were vertue in his Bones to pre<U+017F>erve you again<U+017F>t Monarchie. Yet all this while you pretend not only zeal for the Publick good; but a due veneration for the per<U+017F>on of the King. But all men who can <U+017F>ee an inch before them, may ea<U+017F>ily detect tho<U+017F>e gro<U+017F>s fallacies. That it is nece<U+017F><U+017F>arie for men in your circum<U+017F>tances to pretend both, is granted you: for without them there could be no ground to rai<U+017F>e a Faction. But I would ask you one civil que<U+017F>tion, what right has any man among you, or any A<U+017F><U+017F>ociation of men, (to come nearer to you) who out of Parliament, cannot be con<U+017F>ider'd in a publick Capacity, to meet, as you daily doe, in Factious Clubs, to vilify the Government in your Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, and to libel it in all your Writings? who made you Judges in <hi>I<U+017F>rael?</hi> or how is it con<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with your Zeal of the publick welfare, to promote Sedition? Does your definition of loyal, which is to <U+017F>erve the King according to the Laws, allow you the licence of traducing the Executive Power, with which you own he is inve<U+017F>ted? You complain that his Maje<U+017F>tie has lo<U+017F>t the love and confidence of his People: and by your very urging it, you endeavour what, in you lies, to make him lo<U+017F>e them. All good Subjects abhor the thought of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power, whether it be in one or many: if you were the Patriots you would <U+017F>eem, you would not at this rate incen<U+017F>e the Multitude to a<U+017F><U+017F>ume it: for no <U+017F>ober man can fear it, either from the King's Di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition, or his Practice: or even, where you would odiou<U+017F>ly lay it, from his Mini<U+017F>ters. Give us leave to enjoy the Government and the benefit of Laws under which we were born, and which we de<U+017F>ire to tran<U+017F>mit to our Po<U+017F>terity. You are not the Tru<U+017F>tees of the publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: and if you have not right to petition in a Crowd, much le<U+017F>s have you to intermeddle in the management of Affairs:
<pb facs="tcp:44131:3"/>
or to arraign what you do not like: which in effect is every thing that is done by the King and Council. Can you imagine that any rea<U+017F>onable man will believe you re<U+017F>pect the per<U+017F>on of his Maje<U+017F>ty, when 'tis apparent that your Seditious Pamphlets are <U+017F>tuff'd with particular Reflexions on him? If you have the confidence to deny this, 'tis ea<U+017F>y to be evinc'd from a thou<U+017F>and Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, which I only forbear to quote, becau<U+017F>e I de<U+017F>ire they <U+017F>hould die and be forgotten. I bave perus'd many of your Papers: and to <U+017F>how you that I have, the third part of your <hi>No-ptote<U+017F>tant Plot</hi> is much of it <U+017F>tolen, from your dead Author's Pamphlet call'd, the <hi>Growth of Popery:</hi> as manife<U+017F>tly as <hi>Milton's</hi> defence of the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> People, is from <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan, de jure regni apud Scotos:</hi> or your fir<U+017F>t Covenant, and new A<U+017F><U+017F>ociation, from the holy League of the <hi>French Gui<U+017F>ards.</hi> Any one who reads <hi>Davila,</hi> may trace your Practices all along. There were the <U+017F>ame pretences for Reformation, and Loyalty, the <U+017F>ame A<U+017F>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ions of the King, and the <U+017F>ame grounds of a Rebellion. <hi>I</hi> know not whether you will take the Hi<U+017F>torian's word, who <U+017F>ays it was reported, that <hi>Poltrot</hi> a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> murther'd <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Gui<U+017F>e</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tigations of <hi>Theodore Beza:</hi> or that it was a <hi>Hugonot</hi> Mini<U+017F>ter, otherwi<U+017F>e call'd a <hi>Presbyterian<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
               </hi> (for our Church abhors <U+017F>o devili<U+017F>h a Tenent) who fir<U+017F>t writ a Treati<U+017F>e of the lawfulne<U+017F>s of depo<U+017F>ing and murthering Kings, of a different Per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion in Religion: But <hi>I</hi> am able to prove from the Doctrine of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and Principles of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan,</hi> that they <U+017F>et the People above the Magi<U+017F>trate: which if I mi<U+017F>take not, is your own Fundamental: and which carries your Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty no further than your likeing. When a Vote of the Hou<U+017F>e of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons goes on your <U+017F>ide, you are as ready to ob<U+017F>erve it, as if it were pa<U+017F>s'd into a Law: But when you are pinch'd with any former, and yet unrepealed <hi>Act of Paliament,</hi> you declare that in <U+017F>ome ca<U+017F>es, you will not be oblig'd by it. The Pa<U+017F>sage is in the <U+017F>ame third part of the <hi>No-prote<U+017F>tant Plot:</hi> &amp; is too plain to be denied. The late Copy of your intended A<U+017F><U+017F>ociation, you neither wholly ju<U+017F>tify nor condemn; But, as the Papi<U+017F>ts, when they are unoppos'd, fly out into all the Pageantry's of Wor<U+017F>hip; but in times of War, when they are hard pre<U+017F>s'd by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:44131:4"/>
lie clo<U+017F>s intrinch'd behind the <hi>Council of Trent:</hi> So, now, when your Affairs are in a low condition, you dare not pretend that to be a legal Combination, but when<U+017F>oever you are afloat, <hi>I</hi> doubt not but it will be maintain'd and ju<U+017F>tify'd to purpo<U+017F>e. For indeed there is nothing to defend it but the Sword: 'tis the proper time to <U+017F>ay any thing, when men have all things in their power.</p>
            <p>In the mean time you wou'd fain be nibbling at a parallel betwixt this A<U+017F><U+017F>ociation, and that in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> But there is this <U+017F>mall difference betwixt them, that the ends of the one are directly oppo<U+017F>ite to the other: one with the Queens approbation, and conjunction, as head of it: the other without either the con<U+017F>ent, or knowledge of the King, again<U+017F>t who<U+017F>e Authority it is manife<U+017F>tly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>igned. Therefore you do well to have recour<U+017F>e to your la<U+017F>t Eva<U+017F>ion, that it was contriv'd by your Enemies, and <U+017F>huffled into the Papers that were <U+017F>eiz'd: which yet you <U+017F>ee the Nation is not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>y to believe as your own Jury; But the matter is not difficult, to find twelve men in <hi>New-gate,</hi> who wou'd acquit a Malefactour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have one onely favour to de<U+017F>ire of you at parting, that when you think of an<U+017F>wering this <hi>Poem,</hi> you wou'd employ the <U+017F>ame Pens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t it, who have combated with <U+017F>o much <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s again<U+017F>t <hi>Ab<U+017F>alom</hi> and <hi>Achitophel:</hi> for then you may a<U+017F><U+017F>ure your <U+017F>elves of a clear Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, without the lea<U+017F>t reply. Raile at me abundantly; and, not to break a Cu<U+017F>tome, doe it without wit: By this method you will gain a con<U+017F>iderable point, which is wholly to wave the an<U+017F>wer of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. Never own the botome of your Principles, for fear they <U+017F>hou'd be Trea<U+017F>on.

If <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel</hi> <U+017F>ignify the Brother of a Fool, the Author of that Poem will pa<U+017F>s with his Readers for the next of kin; perhaps' tis the Relation that makes the kindne<U+017F>s.

What wou'd you have more of a man? he has damn'd me in your Cau<U+017F>e from <hi>Gene<U+017F>is</hi> to the <hi>Revelations:</hi> And has half the Texts of both the <hi>Te<U+017F>taments</hi> again<U+017F>t me, if you will be <U+017F>o civil to your <U+017F>elves as to take him for your interpreter; and not to take them for <hi>Iri<U+017F>h</hi> Witne<U+017F><U+017F>es. After all, perhaps you will tell me, that you retain'd him only for the opening of your Cau<U+017F>e, and that your main Lawyer is yet behind. Now if it <U+017F>o happen he meet with no more reply than his Predece<U+017F>sours, you may either conclude, that <hi>I</hi> tru<U+017F>t to the goodne<U+017F>s of my Cau<U+017F>e, or fear my Adver<U+017F>ary or di<U+017F>dain him, or what you plea<U+017F>e, for the <U+017F>hort on't is, 'tis indifferent to your humble <U+017F>ervant, whatever your Party <U+017F>ays or thinks of him.</p>
