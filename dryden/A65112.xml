            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I <hi>HAVE found it not more difficult to Tran<U+017F>late</hi> Virgil, <hi>than to find <U+017F>uch Patrons as I de<U+017F>ire for my Tran<U+017F>lation. For though</hi> England <hi>is not wanting in a Learned Nobility, yet <U+017F>uch are my unhappy Circum<U+017F>tances, that they have confin'd me to a narrow choice. To the greater part, I have not the Honour to be known; and to <U+017F>ome of them I cannot <U+017F>hew at pre<U+017F>ent, by any publick Act, that grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Re<U+017F>pect which I <U+017F>hall ever bear them in my heart. Yet I have no rea<U+017F>on to complain of Fortune, <U+017F>ince in the mid<U+017F>t of that abundance I could not po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly have cho<U+017F>en better, than the Worthy Son of <U+017F>o Illu<U+017F>trious a Father. He was the Patron of my Manhood, when I Flouri<U+017F>h'd in the opinion of the World; though with <U+017F>mall advantage to my Fortune, 'till he awaken'd the remembrance of my Royal Ma<U+017F>ter. He was that</hi> Pollio, <hi>or that</hi> Varus, <hi>who introduc'd me to</hi> Augu<U+017F>tus: <hi>And tho' he <U+017F>oon di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s'd him<U+017F>elf from State-Affairs, yet in the <U+017F>hort time of his Admini<U+017F>tration he <U+017F>hone <U+017F>o powerfully upon me, that like the heat of a</hi> Ru<U+017F><U+017F>ian<hi>-Summer, he ripen'd the Fruits of Poetry in a cold Clymate; and gave me wherewithal to <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>t at lea<U+017F>t, in the long Winter which <U+017F>ucceeded. What I now offer to your Lord<U+017F>hip, is the wretched remainder of a <U+017F>ickly Age, worn out with Study, and oppre<U+017F>s'd by Fortune: without other <U+017F>upport than the Con<U+017F>tancy and Patience of a Chri<U+017F>tian. You, my Lord, are yet in the flower of your Youth, and may live to enjoy the benefits of the Peace which is promis'd</hi> Europe: <hi>I can only hear of that Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing: for Years, and, above all things, want of health, have <U+017F>hut me out from <U+017F>haring in the happine<U+017F>s. The Poets, who condemn their</hi> Tantalus <hi>to Hell, had added to his Torments, if they had plac'd him in</hi> Ely<U+017F>ium, <hi>which is the proper Emblem of my Condition. The Fruit and the Water may reach my Lips, but cannot enter: And if they cou'd, yet I want a Palate as well as a Dige<U+017F>tion. But it is <U+017F>ome kind of plea<U+017F>ure to me, to plea<U+017F>e</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:3"/>
                     <hi>tho<U+017F>e whom I re<U+017F>pect. And I am not altogether out of hope, that the<U+017F>e</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>torals <hi>of</hi> Virgil <hi>may give your Lord<U+017F>hip <U+017F>ome delight, though made En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli<U+017F>h by one, who <U+017F>carce remembers that Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion which in<U+017F>pir'd my Author when he wrote them. The<U+017F>e were his fir<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ay in Poetry, (if the</hi> Ceiris <hi>was not his:) And it was more excu<U+017F>able in him to de<U+017F>cribe Love when he was young, than for me to Tran<U+017F>late him when I am Old. He died at the Age of fifty two, and I began this Work in my great</hi> Clymacterique. <hi>But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perhaps a better con<U+017F>titution than my Author, I have wrong'd him le<U+017F>s, con<U+017F>idering my Circum<U+017F>tances, than tho<U+017F>e who have attempted him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either in our own, or any Modern Language. And though this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion is not void of Errours, yet it comforts me that the faults of others are not worth finding. Mine are neither gro<U+017F>s nor frequent, in tho<U+017F>e</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, <hi>wherein my Ma<U+017F>ter has rais'd him<U+017F>elf above that humble Stile in which</hi> Pa<U+017F>toral <hi>delights, and which I mu<U+017F>t confefs is proper to the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conver<U+017F>e of Shepherds: for he found the <U+017F>trength of his Genius b<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>times, and was even in his youth preluding to his</hi> Georgics, <hi>and his</hi> Aeneis. <hi>He cou'd not forbear to try his Wings, though his Pinions were not harden'd to maintain a long laborious flight. Yet <U+017F>ometimes they bore him to a pitch as lofty, as ever he was able to reach afterwards. But when he was admoni<U+017F>h'd by his <U+017F>ubject to de<U+017F>cend, he came down gently circling in the air, and <U+017F>inging to the ground. Like a Lark, melodious in her mounting, and continuing her Song 'till <U+017F>he alights: <U+017F>till preparing for a higher flight at her next <U+017F>ally, and tuning her voice to better mu<U+017F>ick. The Fourth, the Sixth, and the Eighth</hi> Pa<U+017F>torals, <hi>are clear Evidences of this truth. In the three fir<U+017F>t he contains him<U+017F>elf within his bounds; but Addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing to</hi> Pollio, <hi>his great Patron, and him<U+017F>elf no vulgar Poet, he no longer cou'd re<U+017F>train the freedom of his Spirit, but began to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert his Native Character, which is <U+017F>ublimity. Putting him<U+017F>elf under the conduct of the <U+017F>ame</hi> Cumaean Sybil, <hi>whom afterwards he gave for a Guide to his</hi> Aeneas. <hi>'Tis true he was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of his own boldne<U+017F>s; and we know it by the</hi> Paulo Majora, <hi>which begins his Fourth</hi> Eclogue. <hi>He remember'd, like young</hi> Manlius, <hi>that he was forbidden to Engage; but what avails an expre<U+017F>s Command to a youthful Courage, which pre<U+017F>ages Victory in the attempt? Encourag'd with Succe<U+017F>s, he proceeds farther in the Sixth, and invades the Province of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>ophy. And notwith<U+017F>tanding that</hi> Phoebus <hi>had forewarn'd him of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wars, as he there confe<U+017F><U+017F>es, yet he pre<U+017F>um'd that the <U+017F>earch of Nature was as free to him as to</hi> Lucretius, <hi>who at his Age explain'd it according to the Principles of</hi> Epicurus. <hi>In his Eighth</hi> Eclogue, <hi>he has innovated nothing; the former part of it being the Complaint and De<U+017F>pair of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aken Lover: the latter, a Charm of an Enchantre<U+017F>s, to renew a lo<U+017F>t Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But the Complaint perhaps contains <U+017F>ome Topicks which are above the Condition of his Per<U+017F>ons; and our Author <U+017F>eems to have made his Herd<U+017F>men <U+017F>omewhat too Learn'd for their Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion: The Charms are al<U+017F>o of the <U+017F>ame nature, but both were Copied from</hi> Theocritus, <hi>and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the applau<U+017F>e of former Ages in their Original. There is a kind of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ticity in all tho<U+017F>e pompous Ver<U+017F>es; <U+017F>omewhat of a Holiday Shepherd <U+017F>trut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his Country Buskins. The like may be ob<U+017F>erv'd, both in the</hi> Pollio, <hi>and the</hi> Silenus; <hi>where the Similitudes are drawn from the Woods and Meadows. They <U+017F>eem to me to repre<U+017F>ent our Poet betwixt a Farmer, and a Courtier, when he left</hi> Mantua <hi>for</hi> Rome, <hi>and dre<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf in his be<U+017F>t Habit to appear before his Patron: Somewhat too fine for the place from whence he came, and yet retaining part of its <U+017F>implicity. In the Ninth</hi> Pa<U+017F>toral <hi>he Collects <U+017F>ome Beautiful pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages which were <U+017F>catter'd in</hi> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus, <hi>which he cou'd not in<U+017F>ert into any of his former</hi> Eclogues, <hi>and yet</hi>

You have read him with plea<U+017F>ure, and I dare <U+017F>ay, with admiration in the Latine, of which you are a Ma<U+017F>ter. You have added to your Natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, which without flattery are Eminent, the <U+017F>uper<U+017F>tructures of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the knowledge of good Authors. Courage, Probity, and Humanity are inherent in you. The<U+017F>e Vertues have ever been habitual to the Ancient Hou<U+017F>e of</hi> Cumberland, <hi>from whence you are de<U+017F>cended, and of which our Chronicles make <U+017F>o honourable mention in the long Wars betwixt the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Families of</hi> York <hi>and</hi> Lanca<U+017F>ter. <hi>Your Forefathers have a<U+017F><U+017F>erted the Party which they cho<U+017F>e 'till death, and dy'd for its defence in the Fields of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.

You are acquainted with the</hi> Roman <hi>Hi<U+017F>tory, and know without my information that Patronage and Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent<U+017F>hip always de<U+017F>cended from the Fathers to the Sons; and that the <U+017F>ame</hi> Plebeian <hi>Hou<U+017F>es, had recour<U+017F>e to the <U+017F>ame Patrician Line, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly protected them: and follow'd their Principles and Fortunes to the la<U+017F>t. So that I am your Lord<U+017F>hip's by de<U+017F>cent, and part of your Inheritance. And the natural inclination, which I have to <U+017F>erve you, adds to your paternal right, for I was wholly yours from the fir<U+017F>t moment, when I had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s and honour of being known to you. Be pleas'd therefore to accept the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of</hi> Virgil<hi>'s Poetry: Cour<U+017F>ely Tran<U+017F>lated I confe<U+017F>s, but which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <U+017F>ome Beauties of the Author, which neither the barbarity of our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, nor my unskilfulne<U+017F>s cou'd <U+017F>o much <U+017F>ully, but that they appear <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the dim mirrour which I hold before you. The Subject is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uitable to your Youth, which allows you yet to Love, and is proper to your pre<U+017F>ent Scene of Life. Rural Recreations abroad, and Books at home, are the innocent Plea<U+017F>ures of a Man who is early Wi<U+017F>e; and gives Fortune no more hold of him, than of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity he mu<U+017F>t. 'Tis good, on <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ions to think beforehand as little as we can; to enjoy as much of the pre<U+017F>ent as will not endanger our futurity; and to provide our <U+017F>elves of the</hi> Vertuo<U+017F>o<hi>'s Saddle, which will be <U+017F>ure to amble, when the World is upon the harde<U+017F>t trott.

                  <p>
                     <hi>VIRGIL</hi> was born at <hi>Mantua,</hi> which City was built no le<U+017F>s than Three Hundred Years before <hi>Rome;</hi> and was the Capital of the New <hi>Hetruria,</hi> as him<U+017F>elf, no le<U+017F>s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary, than Poet, a<U+017F><U+017F>ures us. His Birth is <U+017F>aid to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in the fir<U+017F>t Con<U+017F>ul<U+017F>hip of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, and <hi>Lic. Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us;</hi> but <U+017F>ince the Relater of this pre<U+017F>ently after contradicts him<U+017F>elf; and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s manner of Addre<U+017F><U+017F>ing to <hi>Octavius,</hi> implies a greater difference of Age than that of Seven Years, as appears by his Fir<U+017F>t Pa<U+017F>toral, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places; it is rea<U+017F>onable to <U+017F>et the Date of it <U+017F>omething back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: And the Writer of his Life having no certain Memorials to work upon, <U+017F>eems to have pitched upon the two mo<U+017F>t Illu<U+017F>trious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>uls he could find about that time, to <U+017F>ignalize the Birth of <U+017F>o Eminent a Man. But it is beyond all Que<U+017F>tion, that he was Born on, or near the Fifteenth of <hi>October.</hi> Which Day was kept Fe<U+017F>tival in honour of his Memory, by the <hi>Latin,</hi> as the Birth-Day of <hi>Homer</hi> was by the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets. And <U+017F>o near a re<U+017F>emblance there is, betwixt the Lives of the<U+017F>e two famous <hi>Epic</hi> Writers, that <hi>Virgil</hi> <U+017F>eems to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the <hi>Fortune</hi> of the other, as well as the Subject and manner of his Writing. For <hi>Homer</hi> is <U+017F>aid to have been of very mean Parents, <U+017F>uch as got their Bread by Day-labour; <U+017F>o is <hi>Virgil. Homer</hi> is <U+017F>aid to be <hi>Ba<U+017F>e Born;</hi> <U+017F>o is <hi>Virgil.</hi> The former to have been born in the open Air, in a Ditch, or by the Bank of a River; <U+017F>o is the latter. There was a Poplar Planted near the place of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Birth, which <U+017F>uddenly grew up to an unu<U+017F>ual heighth and bulk, and to which the Super<U+017F>titious Neighbourhood attributed marvellous Vertue. <hi>Homer</hi> had his Poplar too, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> relates, which was vi<U+017F>ited with great Veneration. <hi>Homer</hi> is de<U+017F>crib'd by one of the Ancients, to have been of a <U+017F>lovenly and neglected Meen and Habit, <U+017F>o was <hi>Virgil.</hi> Both were of a very delicate and <U+017F>ickly Con<U+017F>titution: Both addicted to Travel, and the <U+017F>tudy of A<U+017F>trology: Both had their Compo<U+017F>itions u<U+017F>urp'd by others: Both Envy'd and traduc'd during their Lives. We know not <U+017F>o much as the true Names of either of them with any exactne<U+017F>s: For the Criticks are not yet agreed how the word <hi>[Virgil]</hi> <U+017F>hould be Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Name there is no certainty at all. Who<U+017F>oever
<pb facs="tcp:43031:5"/>
<U+017F>hall con<U+017F>ider this Parallel in <U+017F>o many particulars; (and more might be added) would be inclin'd to think, that either the <U+017F>ame Stars Rul'd <U+017F>trongly at the Nativities of them both, or what is a great deal more probable; that the <hi>Latin</hi> Grammarians wanting Materials for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Life, after the <hi>Legendary Fa<U+017F>hion,</hi> <U+017F>upply'd it out of <hi>Herodotus;</hi> and like ill Face-Painters, not being able to hit the true <hi>Features,</hi> endeavour'd to make amends by a great deal of impertinent <hi>Land<U+017F>cape</hi> and <hi>Drapery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Without troubling the Reader with needle<U+017F>s Quotations, now, or afterwards; the mo<U+017F>t probable Opinion is, that <hi>Virgil</hi> was the Son of a Servant, or A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tant to a wandring <hi>A<U+017F>trologer;</hi> who practis'd Phy<U+017F>ic. For <hi>Medicus, Magus,</hi> as <hi>Juvenal</hi> ob<U+017F>erves, u<U+017F>ually went together; and this cour<U+017F>e of Life was follow'd by a great many <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Syrians;</hi> of one of which Nations it <U+017F>eems not improbable, that <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Father was. Nor could a Man of that Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion have cho<U+017F>en a fitter place to <U+017F>ettle in, than that mo<U+017F>t Super<U+017F>titious Tract of <hi>Italy;</hi> which by her ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Rites and Ceremonies as much en<U+017F>lav'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi> did the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> by their Arms. This Man therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got together <U+017F>ome Money, which Stock he improv'd by his Skill in Planting and Husbandry, had the good Fortune, at la<U+017F>t, to Marry his Ma<U+017F>ters Daughter, by whom he had <hi>Virgil;</hi> and this Woman <U+017F>eems, by her Mothers <U+017F>ide, to have been of good Extraction; for <U+017F>he was nearly related to <hi>Quintilius Varus,</hi> whom <hi>Paterculus</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ures us to have been an Illu<U+017F>trious, tho' not Patrician Family; and there is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mention made of it in the Hi<U+017F>tory of the <U+017F>econd <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War. It is certain, that they gave him very good Education, to which they were inclin'd; not <U+017F>o much by the Dreams of his Mother, and tho<U+017F>e pre<U+017F>ages which <hi>Donatus</hi> relates, as by the early indications which he gave of a <U+017F>weet Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, and Excellent Wit. He pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed the fir<U+017F>t Seven Years of his Life at <hi>Mantua,</hi> not Seventeen, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> mi<U+017F>corrects his Author; for the <hi>initia aetatis</hi> can hardly be <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ed to extend <U+017F>o far. From thence he removed to <hi>Cremona,</hi> a Noble <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, and afterwards to <hi>Milan.</hi> In all which places he pro<U+017F>ecuted his Studies with great application; he read over, all the be<U+017F>t <hi>Latin,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, for which he had convenience by the no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote di<U+017F>tance of <hi>Mar<U+017F>eils,</hi> that famous <hi>Greek</hi> Colony, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd its Politene<U+017F>s, and Purity of Language, in the mid<U+017F>t of all tho<U+017F>e Barbarous Nations among<U+017F>t which it was <U+017F>eated: And <U+017F>ome Tincture of the latter <U+017F>eems to have de<U+017F>cended from them down to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>French.</hi> He frequented the mo<U+017F>t Eminent Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ors of the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> Philo<U+017F>ophy, which was then much in vogue, and will be always in declining and <U+017F>ickly States. But finding no <U+017F>atisfactory Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from his Ma<U+017F>ter <hi>Syron,</hi> he pa<U+017F>s'd over to the <hi>Academick School,</hi> to which he adher'd the re<U+017F>t of his Life, and de<U+017F>erv'd, from a great Emperour, the Title of the <hi>Plato</hi> of <hi>Poets.</hi> He compos'd at lei<U+017F>ure hours a great number of Ver<U+017F>es, on various Subjects; and de<U+017F>irous rather of a <hi>great,</hi> than <hi>early</hi> Fame, he permitted his Kin<U+017F>man, and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-<U+017F>tudent <hi>Varus,</hi> to derive the Honour of one of his Tragedies to him<U+017F>elf. Glory neglected in proper time and place, returns often with large Increa<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o he found it: For <hi>Varus</hi> afterwards prov'd a great In<U+017F>trument of his Ri<U+017F>e: In <U+017F>hort, it was here that he form'd the <hi>Plan,</hi> and collected the Materials of all tho<U+017F>e excellent Pieces which he afterwards fini<U+017F>h'd, or was forc'd to leave le<U+017F>s perfect by his Death. But whether it were the Unwhol<U+017F>omne<U+017F>s of his Native Air,
<pb facs="tcp:43031:5"/>
of which he <U+017F>omewhere complains, or his too great ab<U+017F>tinence, and Night-watchings at his Study, to which he was always addicted, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<U+017F>tus</hi> ob<U+017F>erves; or po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly the hopes of improving him<U+017F>elf by Travel, he re<U+017F>olv'd to Remove to the more Southern Tract of <hi>Italy;</hi> and it was hardly po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him not to take <hi>Rome</hi> in his Way; as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to any one who <U+017F>hall ca<U+017F>t an Eye on the Map of <hi>Italy:</hi> And therefore the late <hi>French Editor</hi> of his Works is mi<U+017F>taken, when he a<U+017F><U+017F>erts that he never <U+017F>aw <hi>Rome,</hi> 'till he came to Petition for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tate: He gain'd the Acquaintance of the Ma<U+017F>ter of the Hor<U+017F>e to <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> and Cur'd a great many Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es of Hor<U+017F>es, by methods they had never heard of: It fell out, at the <U+017F>ame time, that a very fine Colt, which promi<U+017F>ed great Strength and Speed, was pre<U+017F>ented to <hi>Octavius: Virgil</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd them, that he came of a faulty Mare, and would prove a Jade, upon trial it was found as he had <U+017F>aid; his Judgment prov'd right in <U+017F>everal other in<U+017F>tances, which was the more <U+017F>urprizing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becau<U+017F>e the <hi>Romans</hi> knew lea<U+017F>t of Natural Cau<U+017F>es of any civiliz'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World: And tho<U+017F>e Meteors, and Prodigies which co<U+017F>t them incredible Sums to expiate, might ea<U+017F>ily have been accounted for, by no very profound Naturali<U+017F>t.

Be<U+017F>ides this, <hi>Virgil</hi> had heard of the <hi>A<U+017F><U+017F>yrian,</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prophecies, (which in truth, were no other but the <hi>Jewi<U+017F>h,)</hi> that about that time a great King was to come into the World.

Upon the whole
<pb facs="tcp:43031:6"/>
matter, it is very probable, that <hi>Virgil</hi> Predicted to him the Empire at this time. And it will appear yet the more, if we con<U+017F>ider that he a<U+017F><U+017F>ures him of his being receiv'd into the Number of the Gods, in his Fir<U+017F>t <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral,</hi> long before the thing came to pa<U+017F>s; which Prediction <U+017F>eems grounded upon his former Mi<U+017F>take. This was a <U+017F>ecret, not to be divulg'd at that time, and therefore it is no wonder that the <U+017F>light Story in <hi>Donatus</hi> was given abroad to palliate the matter. But certain it is, that <hi>Octavius</hi> di<U+017F>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ed him with great Marks of e<U+017F>teem, and earne<U+017F>tly recommended the Protection of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Affairs to <hi>Pollio,</hi> then Lieutenant of the <hi>Ci<U+017F>-Alpine Gaule,</hi> where <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Patrimony lay. This <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> from a mean Original, became one of the mo<U+017F>t Con<U+017F>iderable Per<U+017F>ons of his time: A good General, Orator, States-man, Hi<U+017F>torian, Poet, and Favourer of Learned Men; above all, he was a Man of <hi>Honour</hi> in tho<U+017F>e critical times: He had join'd with <hi>Octavius,</hi> and <hi>Antony,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging the Barbarous A<U+017F><U+017F>a<U+017F><U+017F>ination of <hi>Julius Cae<U+017F>ar:</hi> When they two were at variance, he would neither follow <hi>Antony,</hi> who<U+017F>e cour<U+017F>es he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<U+017F>ted, nor join with <hi>Octavius</hi> again<U+017F>t him, out of a grateful Sen<U+017F>e of <U+017F>ome former Obligations. <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> who thought it his intere<U+017F>t to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Men of Principles, notwith<U+017F>tanding this, receiv'd him afterwards into Favour, and promoted him to the highe<U+017F>t Honours. And thus much I thought fit to <U+017F>ay of <hi>Pollio,</hi> becau<U+017F>e he was one of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s greate<U+017F>t Friends. Being therefore eas'd of Dome<U+017F>tick cares, he pur<U+017F>ues his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Naples:</hi> The Charming <U+017F>ituation of that Place, and view of the beautiful <hi>Villa</hi>'s of the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility, equalling the Magnificence of the greate<U+017F>t Kings; the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Baiae,</hi> whither the <hi>Sick</hi> re<U+017F>orted for recovery, and the States-man when he was <hi>Politickly</hi> Sick; whither the wanton went for Plea<U+017F>ure, and witty Men for good Company; the whole<U+017F>omne<U+017F>s of the Air, and improving <hi>Conver<U+017F>ation,</hi> the <hi>be<U+017F>t Air of all,</hi> contributed not only to the re-e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing his Health; but to the forming of his Style, and rendring him Ma<U+017F>ter of that happy turn of Ver<U+017F>e, in which he much <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>es all the <hi>Latins,</hi> and in a le<U+017F>s advantageous Language, equals even <hi>Homer</hi> him<U+017F>elf. He propos'd to u<U+017F>e his Talent in Poetry, only for Scaffolding to Build a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Fortune, that he might Pro<U+017F>ecute with le<U+017F>s interruption, tho<U+017F>e Nobler Studies to which his elevated Genius led him, and which he de<U+017F>cribes in the<U+017F>e admirable Lines.</p>

                  <p>Whil<U+017F>t <hi>Virgil</hi> thus enjoy'd the <U+017F>weets of a Learn'd Privacy, the Troubles of <hi>Italy</hi> cut off his little Sub<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; but by a <U+017F>trange turn of Human Affairs, which ought to keep good Men from ever de<U+017F>pairing; the lo<U+017F>s of his E<U+017F>tate prov'd the effectual way of making his Fortune. The occa<U+017F>ion of it was this; <hi>Octavius,</hi> as him<U+017F>elf relates, when he was but Nineteen Years of Age, by a Ma<U+017F>terly <U+017F>troke of Policy, had gain'd the <hi>Veteran</hi> Legions into his Service, (and by that <U+017F>tep, out-witted all the Republican Senate:) They grew now very clamorous for their Pay: The Trea<U+017F>ury being Exhau<U+017F>ted, he was forc'd to make A<U+017F><U+017F>ign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Land, and none but in <hi>Italy</hi> it <U+017F>elf would content them. He pitch'd upon <hi>Cremona</hi> as the mo<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tant from <hi>Rome;</hi> but that not <U+017F>uffi<U+017F>ing, he afterwards threw in part of the State of <hi>Mantua. Cremona</hi> was a Rich and noble Colony, <U+017F>etled a little before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<U+017F>ion of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> During that Tedious and Bloody War, they had done <U+017F>everal important Services to the Common-Wealth. And when Eighteen other Colonies, pleading Poverty and Depopulation, refus'd to contribute Money, or to rai<U+017F>e Recruits; they of <hi>Cremona</hi> voluntarily

paid a double Quota of both: But pa<U+017F>t Services are a fruitle<U+017F>s Plea; Civil Wars are one continued Act of Ingratitude: In vain did the Mi<U+017F>erable Mothers, with their fami<U+017F>hing Infants in their Arms, fill the Streets with their Numbers, and the Air with Lamentations; the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Legions were to be <U+017F>atisfi'd at any rate. <hi>Virgil,</hi> involv'd in the common Calamity, had recour<U+017F>e to his old Patron <hi>Pollio,</hi> but he was, at this time, under a Cloud; however, compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionating <U+017F>o worthy a Man, not of a make to <U+017F>truggle thro' the World, he did what he could, and recommended him to <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> with whom he <U+017F>till kept a private Corre<U+017F>pondence. The Name of this great Man being much better known than one part of his Character, the Reader, I pre<U+017F>ume, will not be di<U+017F>pleas'd if I <U+017F>upply it in this place.</p>
                  <p>Tho' he was of as deep Reach, and ea<U+017F>ie di<U+017F>patch of Bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s as any in his time, yet he de<U+017F>ignedly liv'd beneath his true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Men had oftentimes medled in Publick Affairs, that they might have more ability to furni<U+017F>h for their Plea<U+017F>ures: <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> by the hone<U+017F>te<U+017F>t Hypocri<U+017F>ie that ever was, pretended to a Life of Plea<U+017F>ure, that he might render more effectual Service to his Ma<U+017F>ter. He <U+017F>eem'd wholly to amu<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf with the Diver<U+017F>ions of the Town, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Mask he was the greate<U+017F>t Mini<U+017F>ter of his Age. He would be carried in a carele<U+017F>s, effeminate po<U+017F>ture thro' the Streets in his Chair, even to the degree of a Proverb, and yet there was not a Cabal of ill di<U+017F>pos'd Per<U+017F>ons which he had not early notice of; and that too in a City as large as <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> and perhaps two or three more of the mo<U+017F>t populous put together. No Man better under<U+017F>tood that Art <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to the <hi>Great;</hi> the Art of <hi>declining Envy:</hi> Being but of a Gentleman's Family, not <hi>Patrician,</hi> he would not provoke the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility by accepting invidious Honours; but wi<U+017F>ely <U+017F>atisfi'd him<U+017F>elf that he had the <hi>Ear</hi> of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> and the <hi>Secret</hi> of the Empire. He <U+017F>eems to have committed but one great Fault, which was the tru<U+017F>ting a Secret of high Con<U+017F>equence to his Wife; but his Ma<U+017F>ter, enough Uxorious him<U+017F>elf, made his <hi>own</hi> Frailty more excu<U+017F>able, by generou<U+017F>ly forgiving that of his Favourite. He kept in all his Greatne<U+017F>s exact mea<U+017F>ures with his Friends; and chu<U+017F>ing them wi<U+017F>ely, found, by Experience, that good <hi>Sen<U+017F>e and Gratitude</hi> are almo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>eparable.

The Title of a Poet in tho<U+017F>e days did not abate, but heighten the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the grave<U+017F>t Senator. <hi>Virgil</hi> was one of the be<U+017F>t and wi<U+017F>e<U+017F>t Men of his time, and in <U+017F>o popular e<U+017F>teem, that one hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and <hi>Romans</hi> ro<U+017F>e when he came into the Theatre, and paid him the <U+017F>ame Re<U+017F>pect they us'd to <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> him<U+017F>elf, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> a<U+017F><U+017F>ures us.

                  <p>And now <hi>Virgil</hi> pro<U+017F>ecutes his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> which had Anciently the Title of the <hi>Imperial Poem,</hi> or <hi>Roman Hi<U+017F>tory,</hi> and de<U+017F>ervedly; for though he were too Artful a Writer to <U+017F>et down Events in exact Hi<U+017F>torical order, for which <hi>Lucan</hi> is ju<U+017F>tly blam'd; yet are all the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable Affairs and Per<U+017F>ons of <hi>Rome</hi> compriz'd in this Poem. He deduces the Hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Italy</hi> from before <hi>Saturn</hi> to the Reign of King <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus;</hi> and reckons up the Succe<U+017F><U+017F>ors of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who Reign'd at <hi>Alba,</hi> for the <U+017F>pace of three hundred Years, down to the Birth of <hi>Romulus;</hi> de<U+017F>cribes the Per<U+017F>ons and principal Exploits of all the Kings, to their Expul<U+017F>ion, and the <U+017F>ettling of the Commonwealth. After this, he touches promi<U+017F>cuou<U+017F>ly the mo<U+017F>t remarkable Occurrences at home and abroad, but in<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts more particularly upon the Exploits of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus;</hi> in<U+017F>omuch, that tho' this A<U+017F><U+017F>ertion may appear, at fir<U+017F>t, a little <U+017F>urpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing; he has in his Works deduc'd the Hi<U+017F>tory of a con<U+017F>iderable part of the World from its <hi>Original,</hi> thro' the <hi>Fabulous</hi> and <hi>Heroick</hi> Ages, thro' the <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the <U+017F>pace of four Thou<U+017F>and Years, down to within le<U+017F>s than Forty of our Saviour's time, of whom he has pre<U+017F>erv'd a mo<U+017F>t Illu<U+017F>trious Prophecy.

His Mother, the Excellent <hi>Octavia,</hi> the <hi>be<U+017F>t Wife of the wor<U+017F>t Husband that ever was,</hi> to divert her Grief, would be of the Auditory. The Poet artificially deferr'd the naming <hi>Marcellus,</hi> 'till their Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions were rais'd to the highe<U+017F>t; but the mention of it put both Her and <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> into <U+017F>uch a Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of weeping, that they commanded him to proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Virgil</hi> an<U+017F>wer'd, that he had already ended that Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. Some relate, that <hi>Octavia</hi> fainted away; but afterwards <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ented the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et with two Thou<U+017F>and one Hundred Pounds, odd Money; a round Sum for Twenty Seven Ver<U+017F>es. Another Writer <U+017F>ays, that with a Royal Magnificence, <U+017F>he order'd him Ma<U+017F><U+017F>y Plate, unweigh'd, to a great value.</p>
                  <p>And now he took up a Re<U+017F>olution of Travelling into <hi>Greece,</hi> there to <U+017F>et the la<U+017F>t Hand to this Work; purpo<U+017F>ing to devote the re<U+017F>t of his Life to Philo<U+017F>ophy, which had been always his principal Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. He ju<U+017F>tly thought it a fooli<U+017F>h Figure for a grave Man to be over-taken by Death, whil<U+017F>t he was weighing the Cadence of Words, and mea<U+017F>uring Ver<U+017F>es; unle<U+017F>s Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity <U+017F>hould con<U+017F>train it, from which he was well <U+017F>ecur'd by the liberality of that I earned Age. But he was not aware, that whil<U+017F>t he allotted three Years for the Revi<U+017F>ing of his Poem, he drew Bills upon a <hi>failing Bank:</hi> For unhappily meeting <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> he thought him<U+017F>elf oblig'd to wait upon him into <hi>Italy,</hi> but being de<U+017F>irous to <U+017F>ee all he could of the <hi>Greek</hi> Antiquities, he fell into a langui<U+017F>hing Di<U+017F>temper at <hi>Megara;</hi> this, neglected at fir<U+017F>t, prov'd Mortal. The agitation of the Ve<U+017F><U+017F>el, for it was now <hi>Autumn,</hi> near the time of his Birth, brought him <U+017F>o low, that he could hardly reach <hi>Brindi<U+017F>i.</hi> In his Sickne<U+017F>s he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with great importunity, call'd for his Scrutore, that he might Burn his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> but <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> interpo<U+017F>ing by his Royal Authority, he made his la<U+017F>t Will, of which <U+017F>omething <U+017F>hall be <U+017F>aid afterwards. And con<U+017F>idering probably how much <hi>Homer</hi> had been disfigur'd by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Compilers of his Works, oblig'd <hi>Tucca</hi> and <hi>Varius</hi> to add nothing, nor <U+017F>o much as fill up the Breaks he left in his Poem.

                     <hi>Virgil</hi> is <U+017F>o far from this complai<U+017F>ant Humour, that his <hi>Heroe</hi> falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an unmanly and ill-tim'd deliberation, whether he <U+017F>hould not kill her in a Church; which directly contradicts what <hi>Deiphobus</hi> <U+017F>ays of her, <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid</hi> 6. in that place where every body tells the truth. He transfers the dogged Silence of <hi>Ajax</hi> his Gho<U+017F>t, to that of <hi>Dido;</hi> tho' that be no very natural Character to an injur'd Lover, or a Woman. He brings in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Matrons <U+017F>etting their own Fleet on Fire; and running after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, like Witches on their <hi>Sabbat,</hi> into the Woods. He be<U+017F>tows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <U+017F>ome Ornaments upon the Character of <hi>Camilla;</hi> but <U+017F>oon abates his Favour, by calling her <hi>a<U+017F>pera &amp; horrenda Virgo:</hi> He places her in the Front of the line for an ill Omen of the Battel, as one of the Ancients has ob<U+017F>erv'd; (we may ob<U+017F>erve, on this occa<U+017F>ion, it is an Art peculiar to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> to intimate the Event by <U+017F>ome preceding Accident.) He hardly ever de<U+017F>cribes the ri<U+017F>ing of the Sun, but with <U+017F>ome circum<U+017F>tance which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ignifies the Fortune of the Day. For in<U+017F>tance, when <hi>Aeneas</hi> leaves <hi>Africa</hi> and Queen <hi>Dido,</hi> he thus de<U+017F>cribes the fatal Morning:

[And for the Remark, we <U+017F>tand indebted to the curious Pencil of <hi>Pollio.]</hi> The <hi>Mourning Fields (Aeneid.</hi> 6.) are crowded with Ladies of a lo<U+017F>t Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
<pb facs="tcp:43031:12"/>
Hardly one Man gets admittance, and that is <hi>Caeneus,</hi> for a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Rea<U+017F>on. <hi>Latinus</hi> his Queen is turbulent, and ungovernable, and at la<U+017F>t hangs her <U+017F>elf: And the fair <hi>Lavinia</hi> is di<U+017F>obedient to the Oracle, and to the King, and looks a little flickering after <hi>Turnus.</hi> I wonder at this the more, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Livy</hi> repre<U+017F>ents her as an excellent Per<U+017F>on, and who behav'd her <U+017F>elf with great Wi<U+017F>dom in her Regency during the minority of her Son: So that the Poet has done her Wrong, and it reflects on her Po<U+017F>terity. His Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es make as ill a Figure; <hi>Juno</hi> is always in a rage, and the Fury of Heaven: <hi>Venus</hi> grows <U+017F>o unrea<U+017F>onably confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as to ask her Husband to forge Arms for her Ba<U+017F>tard Son; which were enough to provoke one of a more Phlegmatick Temper than <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> was. Notwith<U+017F>tanding all this raillery of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s, he was certainly of a very Amorous di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, and has de<U+017F>crib'd all that is mo<U+017F>t delicate in the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Love; but he Conquer'd his natural Inclinations by the help of Philo<U+017F>ophy; and refin'd it into Friend<U+017F>hip, to which he was extreamly <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible. The Reader will admit of or reject the following Conjecture, with the free leave of the Writer, who will be equally pleas'd either way. <hi>Virgil</hi> had too great an Opinion of the Influence of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies: An Ancient Writer <U+017F>ays, that he was born under the Sign of <hi>Virgo,</hi> with which Nativity perhaps he pleas'd him<U+017F>elf, and would exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie her <hi>Vertues</hi> in his Life. Perhaps it was thence that he took his Name of <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Parthenias,</hi> which does not nece<U+017F><U+017F>arily <U+017F>ignifie <hi>Ba<U+017F>e-born. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi> and <hi>Servius,</hi> very good Grammarians, give a quite contrary <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of it. He <U+017F>eems to make allu<U+017F>ion to this Original of his Name in that Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age,
<q>
                        <l>Illo Virgilium me tempore dulcis alebat,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>And this may <U+017F>erve to illu<U+017F>trate his Complement to <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> in which he invites him into his own Con<U+017F>tellation,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Where, in the void of Heaven, a place is free,</hi>

Thus placing him betwixt Ju<U+017F>tice and Power, and in a Neighbour Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion to his own; for <hi>Virgil</hi> <U+017F>uppos'd Souls to a<U+017F>cend again to their <hi>proper Stars.</hi> Being therefore of this Humour, it is no wonder that he refus'd the Embraces of the Beautiful <hi>Plotia,</hi> when his indi<U+017F>creet Friend almo<U+017F>t threw her into his Arms.</p>
                  <p>But however he <U+017F>tood affected to the Ladies, there is a dreadful Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ation brought again<U+017F>t him for the mo<U+017F>t unnatural of all Vices, which by the Malignity of Humane nature has found more Credit in latter times than it did near his own.

                  <p>The <hi>Cretans</hi> were Anciently much addicted to Navigation, in<U+017F>omuch that it became A <hi>Greek</hi> Proverb, (tho' omitted, I think, by the Indu<U+017F>trious <hi>Era<U+017F>mus,)</hi> A <hi>Cretan that does not know the Sea.</hi> Their Neighbourhood gave them occa<U+017F>ion of frequent Commerce with the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> that accur<U+017F>ed People, who infected the <hi>We<U+017F>tern</hi> World with endle<U+017F>s Super<U+017F>titions, and gro<U+017F>s immoralities. From them it is probable, that the <hi>Cretans</hi> learn'd this infamous Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, to which they were <U+017F>o much addicted, that <hi>Cicero</hi> remarks, in his Book <hi>de Rep.</hi> that it was <hi>a di<U+017F>grace for a young Gentleman to be without Lovers.

<pb facs="tcp:43031:12"/>
Beauty is to be lov'd, in the following Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age; for I will not trouble the Reader, weary perhaps already with a long <hi>Greek</hi> Quotation. <hi>There is but one Eternal, Immutable, <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>niform Beauty; in contemplation of which, our Soveraign Happine<U+017F>s does con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t: And therefore a true Lover con<U+017F>iders Beauty and Proportion as <U+017F>o many Steps and Degrees, by which he may a<U+017F>cend from the particular to the general, from all that is lovely of Feature, or regular in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or charming in Sound, to the general Fountain of all Beauty and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if you are <U+017F>o much tran<U+017F>ported with the <U+017F>ight of Beautiful Per<U+017F>ons, as to wi<U+017F>h neither to Eat or drink, but pa<U+017F>s your whole Life in looking on them; to what exta<U+017F>ie would it rai<U+017F>e you to behold the Original Beauty, not fill'd up with Fle<U+017F>h and Blood, or varni<U+017F>h'd with a fading mixture of Colours, and the re<U+017F>t of Mortal Trifles and Fooleries, but <U+017F>eparate, unmix'd, uniform, and divine,</hi> &amp;c. Thus far <hi>Socrates,</hi> in a <U+017F>train, much beyond the <hi>Socrate Cre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">¯</g>tien</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ac:</hi> And thus that admirable Man lov'd his <hi>Phoedon,</hi> his <hi>Charmides,</hi> and <hi>Theatetus;</hi> and thus <hi>Virgil</hi> lov'd his <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Cebes,</hi> under the feign'd Name of <hi>Alexis:</hi> He receiv'd them illiterate, but return'd them to their <hi>Ma<U+017F>ters,</hi> the one a good Poet, and the other an excellent Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian: And to prevent all po<U+017F><U+017F>ible Mi<U+017F>interpretations, he warily in<U+017F>ert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the livelie<U+017F>t <hi>Epi<U+017F>ode</hi> in the whole <hi>Aeneis,</hi> the<U+017F>e words,

And in the Sixth, <hi>Quique pii vates.</hi> He feems fond of the Words, <hi>ca<U+017F>tus, pius, Virgo,</hi> and the Compounds of it; and <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>tretches the U<U+017F>e of that word further than one would think he rea<U+017F>onably <U+017F>hould have done, as when he attributes it to <hi>Pa<U+017F>iphaé</hi> her <U+017F>elf.</p>
                  <p>Another Vice he is Tax'd with, is Avarice; becau<U+017F>e he dy'd Rich, and <U+017F>o indeed he did in compari<U+017F>on of modern Wealth; his E<U+017F>tate amounts to near Seventy Five Thou<U+017F>and Pounds of our Money: But <hi>Donatus</hi> does not take notice of this as a thing extraordinary; nor was it e<U+017F>teem'd <U+017F>o great a Matter, when the Ca<U+017F>h of a great part of the World lay at <hi>Rome; Antony</hi> him<U+017F>elf be<U+017F>tow'd at once Two Thou<U+017F>and Acres of Land in one of the be<U+017F>t Provinces of <hi>Italy,</hi> upon a ridiculous Poet, who is nam'd by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> A late Cardinal us'd to purcha<U+017F>e ill flattery at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of 100000 Crowns a Year. But be<U+017F>ides <hi>Virgil</hi>'s other Benefactors, he was much in favour with <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> who<U+017F>e Bounty to him had no limits, but <U+017F>uch as the Mode<U+017F>ty of <hi>Virgil</hi> pre<U+017F>crib'd to it. Before he had made his own Fortune, he <U+017F>etled his E<U+017F>tate upon his Parents and Brothers; <U+017F>ent them Yearly large Sums, <U+017F>o that they liv'd in great Plenty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect; and at his Death, divided his E<U+017F>tate betwixt <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> leaving one half to his Relations, and the other to <hi>Mecenas,</hi> to <hi>Tucca</hi> and <hi>Varius,</hi> and a con<U+017F>iderable Legacy to <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> who had introduc'd a politick Fa<U+017F>hion of being in every bodies Will; which alone was a fair Revenue for a Prince. <hi>Virgil</hi> <U+017F>hews his dete<U+017F>tation of this Vice, by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the front of the Damn'd tho<U+017F>e who did not relieve their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Friends; for the <hi>Romans</hi> hardly ever extended their Liberality further; and therefore I do not remember to have met in all the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, one Character <U+017F>o noble as that <U+017F>hort one in <hi>Homer.</hi>

Counte<U+017F>s of <hi>C.</hi> was the <hi>Helen of her Country.</hi> There is nothing in Pagan Philo<U+017F>ophy more true, more ju<U+017F>t, and regular than <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Ethics;</hi> and it is hardly po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to <U+017F>it down to the <U+017F>erious peru<U+017F>ual of his Works, but a Man <U+017F>hall ri<U+017F>e more di<U+017F>pos'd to virtue and goodne<U+017F>s, as well as mo<U+017F>t agreeably entertain'd.

But of the <hi>Craft</hi> and <hi>Tricking</hi> part of Life, with which <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> abounds, there is nothing to be found in <hi>Virgil;</hi> and therefore <hi>Plato,</hi> who gives the former <U+017F>o many good words, perfumes, Crowns, but at la<U+017F>t <hi>Complementally Bani<U+017F>hes</hi> him his Commonwealth, wou'd have intreated <hi>Virgil</hi> to <U+017F>tay with him, (if they had liv'd in the <U+017F>ame Age,) and intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ted him with <U+017F>ome important Charge in his Government. Thus was his <hi>Life</hi> as cha<U+017F>t as his <hi>Stile,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e who can Critick his <hi>Poetry,</hi> can never find a blemi<U+017F>h in his <hi>Manners;</hi> and one would rather wi<U+017F>h to have that <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> which the Satyri<U+017F>t him<U+017F>elf attributes to him; that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, and evenne<U+017F>s of temper, and patience, which he was Ma<U+017F>ter of in <U+017F>o eminent a degree, than to have the honour of being Author of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> or even of the <hi>Georgics</hi> them<U+017F>elves.</p>
                  <p>Having therefore <U+017F>o little reli<U+017F>h for the u<U+017F>ual amu<U+017F>ements of the world, he pro<U+017F>ecuted his Studies without any con<U+017F>iderable interruption, during the whole cour<U+017F>e of his Life, which one may rea<U+017F>onably conjecture to have been <U+017F>omething longer than 52 years; and therefore it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he became the mo<U+017F>t general Scholar that <hi>Rome</hi> ever bred, unle<U+017F>s <U+017F>ome one <U+017F>hould except <hi>Varro.</hi> Be<U+017F>ides the exact knowledge of Rural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he under<U+017F>tood Medicine, to which Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion he was de<U+017F>ign'd by his Parents.

                     <hi>PREFACE TO THE PASTORALS, With a <U+017F>hort DEFENCE of VIRGIL, Again<U+017F>t <U+017F>ome of the Reflections of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ieur</hi> Fontanelle.</head>
                  <p>AS the Writings of greate<U+017F>t Antiquity are in Ver<U+017F>e, <U+017F>o of all <U+017F>orts of Poetry, <hi>Pa<U+017F>torals</hi> <U+017F>eem the mo<U+017F>t Ancient; being form'd upon the Model of the Fir<U+017F>t <hi>Innocence,</hi> and <hi>Simplicity,</hi> which the Moderns, better to di<U+017F>pence them<U+017F>elves from imitating, have wi<U+017F>ely thought fit to treat as <hi>Fabulous,</hi> and <hi>impracticable;</hi> and yet they, by obeying the <hi>un<U+017F>ophi<U+017F>ticated</hi> Dictates of Nature, enjoy'd the mo<U+017F>t valuable Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ings of Life; a vigorous Health of Body, with a con<U+017F>tant <U+017F>erenity, and freedom of Mind, whil<U+017F>t we, with all our fanciful Refinements, can <U+017F>carcely pa<U+017F>s an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn without <U+017F>ome acce<U+017F>s of a Feaver, or a whole Day, not ruffled by <U+017F>ome unquiet Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. He was not then look'd upon as a very Old Man; who reach'd to a greater Number of Years, than in the<U+017F>e times an ancient Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can rea<U+017F>onably pretend to; and we know the Names of <U+017F>everal, who <U+017F>aw, and practis'd the World for a longer <U+017F>pace of time, than we can read the Account of in any one entire Body of Hi<U+017F>tory. In <U+017F>hort, they invented the mo<U+017F>t u<U+017F>eful Arts, <hi>Pa<U+017F>torage, Tillage, Geometry, Writing, Mu<U+017F>ick, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tronomy,</hi> &amp;c. Whilst the Moderns, like Extravagant Heirs, made rich by their Indu<U+017F>try, ingratefully deride the good Old <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who left them the <hi>E<U+017F>tate.</hi> It is not therefore to be wonder'd at, that <hi>Pa<U+017F>torals</hi> are fallen into Di<U+017F>e<U+017F>teem, together with that Fa<U+017F>hion of Life, upon which they were grounded. And methinks, I <U+017F>ee the Reader already unea<U+017F>ie at this Part of <hi>Virgil,</hi> counting the Pages, and po<U+017F>ting to the <hi>Aeneis;</hi> <U+017F>o delightful an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment is the very Relation of publick Mi<U+017F>chief, and <U+017F>laughter, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to Mankind: and yet <hi>Virgil</hi> pa<U+017F>s'd a much different judgment on his own Works: He valu'd mo<U+017F>t this part, and his <hi>Georgics,</hi> and depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for his Reputation with Po<U+017F>terity: But Cen<U+017F>ures him<U+017F>elf in one of his Letters to <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> for medling with <hi>Heroics,</hi> the Invention of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating Age. This is the Rea<U+017F>on that the Rules of <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral,</hi> are <U+017F>o little known or <U+017F>tudied. <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle, Horace,</hi> and the <hi>E<U+017F><U+017F>ay of Poetry,</hi> take no notice of it. And Mr. <hi>Boileau,</hi> one of the mo<U+017F>t accurate of the Moderns, becau<U+017F>e he never lo<U+017F>es the Ancients out of his Sight, be<U+017F>tows <U+017F>carce half a Page on it.
<pb facs="tcp:43031:14"/>
It is the De<U+017F>ign therefore of the few following pages, to clear this <U+017F>ort of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from vulgar Prejudices; to vindicate our Author from <U+017F>ome unju<U+017F>t Imputations; to look into <U+017F>ome of the Rules of this <U+017F>ort of Poetry, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what <U+017F>ort of Ver<U+017F>ification is mo<U+017F>t proper for it, in which point we are <U+017F>o much inferiour to the Ancients; that this Con<U+017F>ideration alone, were enough to make <U+017F>ome Writers think as they ought, that is, <hi>Meanly,</hi> of their own Performances.</p>
                  <p>As all <U+017F>orts of Poetry con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t in imitation; Pa<U+017F>toral is the <hi>imitation of a Shepherd con<U+017F>ider'd under that Character:</hi> It is requi<U+017F>ite therefore to be a little inform'd of the Condition, and Qualification of the<U+017F>e Shepherds.</p>
                  <p>One of the Ancients has ob<U+017F>erv'd truly, but Satyrically enough, that <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is the Mea<U+017F>ure of every thing:</hi> And thus by a gradual improvement of this mi<U+017F>take, we come to make our own <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Countrey</hi> the Rule and <hi>Standard</hi> of others, and our <U+017F>elves at la<U+017F>t the mea<U+017F>ure of them <hi>all.</hi> We figure the Ancient Countrey-men like our own, leading a painful Life in Poverty and Contempt, without Wit, or Courage, or Education: But Men had quite different Notions of the<U+017F>e things, for the fir<U+017F>t four Thou<U+017F>and Years of the World; Health and Strength were then in more e<U+017F>teem than the refinements of Plea<U+017F>ure; and it was accounted a great deal more Honourable to Till the Ground, or keep a Flock of Sheep, than to di<U+017F><U+017F>olve in Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s, and effeminating Sloath. Hunting has now an Idea of Quality join'd to it, and is become the mo<U+017F>t important Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s in the Life of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; Antiently it was quite otherways. Mr. <hi>Fleury</hi> has <U+017F>everely remark'd, that this Extravagant Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion for Hunting is a <U+017F>trong Proof of our <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic</hi> Extraction, and <U+017F>hews an affinity of Humour with the Savage <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</hi> The Barbarous <hi>Franks</hi> and other <hi>Germans,</hi> (having neither Corn, nor Wine of their own growth,) when they pa<U+017F>s'd the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s'd them<U+017F>elves of Countreys better Cultivated, left the Tillage of the Land to the Old Proprietors; and afterwards did hazard their Lives as freely for their <hi>Diver<U+017F>ion,</hi> as they had done before for their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary <U+017F>ub<U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. The <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> gave this <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g><U+017F>age the <hi>Sacred <U+017F>tamp</hi> of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hion,</hi> and from hence it is that mo<U+017F>t of our Terms of Hunting are <hi>French.</hi> The Reader will, I hope, give me his Pardon for my freedom on this Subject, <U+017F>ince an ill Accident, occa<U+017F>ion'd by Hunting, has kept <hi>England</hi> in pain, the<U+017F>e <U+017F>everal Months together, for one of the <hi>be<U+017F>t,</hi> and <hi>greate<U+017F>t Peers</hi> which <U+017F>he has bred for <U+017F>ome Ages; no le<U+017F>s Illu<U+017F>trious for <hi>Civil Vertues,</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> than his <hi>Ance<U+017F>tors</hi> were for all their Victories in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there are <U+017F>ome Prints <U+017F>till left of the Ancient E<U+017F>teem for Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry and their plain Fa<U+017F>hion of Life in many of our Sir-Names, and in the <hi>E<U+017F>cutcheons</hi> of the mo<U+017F>t Ancient Families, even tho<U+017F>e of the greate<U+017F>t Kings, the <hi>Ro<U+017F>es,</hi> the <hi>Lillies,</hi> the <hi>Thi<U+017F>tle, &amp;c.</hi> It is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, that one of the principal Cau<U+017F>es of the Depo<U+017F>ing of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> was, that he would not allot part of the Day to <U+017F>ome manual Labour, according to the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and Ancient Practice of his Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors. He that reflects on this will be the le<U+017F>s <U+017F>urpriz'd to find that <hi>Charlemaign</hi> Eight Hundred Years ago, order'd his Children to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructed in <U+017F>ome Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion. And Eight Hundred Years yet higher, that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<U+017F>tus</hi> wore no Cloaths but <U+017F>uch as were made by the Hands of the Empre<U+017F>s, and her Daughters; and <hi>Olympias</hi> did the <U+017F>ame for <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. Nor will he wonder that the <hi>Romans,</hi> in great exigency, <U+017F>ent for their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator from the Plow, who<U+017F>e whole E<U+017F>tate was but of Four Acres; too little a <U+017F>pot now for the Orchard, or Kitchin-Garden of a <hi>Private Gentleman.</hi> It is commonly known, that the Founders of three the mo<U+017F>t renown'd Monarchies in the World, were Shepherds: And the Subject of Husbandry has been adorn'd
<pb facs="tcp:43031:14"/>
by the <hi>Writings</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> of more than twenty <hi>Kings.</hi> It ought not therefore to be matter of <U+017F>urprize to a Modern Writer, that Kings, the <hi>Shepherds</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> laid down their fir<U+017F>t <hi>Rudiments</hi> in tending their <hi>mute Subjects;</hi> nor that the Wealth of <hi>Uly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in Flocks and Herds, the Intendants over which, were then in equal e<U+017F>teem with Officers of State in latter times. And therefore <hi>Eumaeus</hi> is call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>< in non-Latin alphabet ></desc>
                     </gap> in <hi>Homer;</hi> not <U+017F>o much becau<U+017F>e <hi>Homer</hi> was a lover of a Countrey Life, to which he rather <U+017F>eems aver<U+017F>e, but by rea<U+017F>on of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Greatne<U+017F>s of his Tru<U+017F>t, and becau<U+017F>e he was the Son of a <hi>King,</hi> <U+017F>tollen away, and Sold by the <hi>Phaenician</hi> Pyrates, which the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> <U+017F>eems not to have taken notice of. Nor will it <U+017F>eem <U+017F>trange, that the Ma<U+017F>ter of the Hor<U+017F>e to King <hi>Latinus,</hi> in the Ninth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> was found in the homely Employment of cleaving Blocks, when news of the fir<U+017F>t Skirmi<U+017F>h betwixt the <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> was brought to him.</p>
                  <p>Being therefore of <U+017F>uch Quality, they cannot be <U+017F>uppos'd <U+017F>o very <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> and <hi>unpoli<U+017F>h'd;</hi> the Learning and good breeding of the World was then in the hands of <U+017F>uch People. He who was cho<U+017F>en by the con<U+017F>ent of all Parties to <hi>arbitrate</hi> <U+017F>o delicate an affair, as which was the <hi>faire<U+017F>t</hi> of the three <hi>Celebrated Beauties</hi> of <hi>Heaven;</hi> he who had the addre<U+017F>s to debauch away <hi>Helen</hi> from her <hi>Husband,</hi> her Native <hi>Country,</hi> and from a <hi>Crown,</hi> under<U+017F>tood what the <hi>French</hi> call by the too <U+017F>oft name of <hi>Gallantry;</hi> he had Accompli<U+017F>hments enough, how ill u<U+017F>e <U+017F>oever he made of them. It <U+017F>eems therefore that Mr. <hi>F.</hi> had not duly con<U+017F>ider'd the matter, when he reflected <U+017F>o <U+017F>everely upon <hi>Virgil,</hi> as if he had not ob<U+017F>erv'd the Laws of <hi>decency</hi> in his <hi>Pa<U+017F>torals,</hi> in making Shepherds <U+017F>peak to things <hi>be<U+017F>ide</hi> their <hi>Character,</hi> and <hi>above</hi> their Capacity. He <hi><U+017F>tands amaz'd that Shepherds <U+017F>hould thunder out, as he expre<U+017F><U+017F>es him<U+017F>elf, the formation of the World, and that too according to the Sy<U+017F>tem of</hi> Epicurus. In truth, <hi><U+017F>ays he, page 176. I cannot tell what to make of this whole piece; (the Sixth</hi> Pa<U+017F>t.) <hi>I can neither comprehend the De<U+017F>ign of the Author, nor the Connexion of the parts; fir<U+017F>t come the Ideas of Philo<U+017F>ophy, and pre<U+017F>ently after tho<U+017F>e incoherent Fables,</hi> &amp;c. To expo<U+017F>e him yet more, he <U+017F>ubjoyns, <hi>it is</hi> Silenus <hi>him<U+017F>elf who makes all this ab<U+017F>urd Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.</hi> Virgil <hi><U+017F>ays in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that he had drank too much the day before; perhaps the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch hung in his head when he compos'd this Poem,</hi> &amp;c. Thus far Mr. <hi>F.</hi> who, to the di<U+017F>grace of Rea<U+017F>on, as him<U+017F>elf ingenuou<U+017F>ly owns, fir<U+017F>t built his Hou<U+017F>e, and then <U+017F>tudied <hi>Architecture;</hi> I mean fir<U+017F>t Compos'd his <hi>Eclogues,</hi> and then <U+017F>tudied the Rules. In an<U+017F>wer to this, we may ob<U+017F>erve, fir<U+017F>t, that this very <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral</hi> which he <U+017F>ingles out to triumph over, was recited by a Famous Player on the <hi>Roman</hi> Theatre, with marvellous applau<U+017F>e; in<U+017F>omuch that <hi>Cicero</hi> who had heard part of it only, order'd the whole to be rehears'd, and <U+017F>truck with admiration of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd then upon <hi>Virgil</hi> the Glorious Title of
<q>Magnae <U+017F>pes alterae Romae.</q>
Nor is it Old <hi>Donatus</hi> only who relates this, we have the <U+017F>ame account from another very Credible and Ancient Author; <U+017F>o that here we have the judgment of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> to confront the <U+017F>ingle Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this adventrous Critick. A Man ought to be well a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd of his own Abilities, before he attack an Author of <hi>e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h'd</hi> Reputation. If Mr. <hi>F.</hi> had perus'd the fragments of the <hi>Phaenician</hi> Antiquity, trac'd the progre<U+017F>s of Learning thro' the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Writers, or <U+017F>o much as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ulted his Learned Countrey-Man <hi>Huetius,</hi> he would have found, (which
<pb facs="tcp:43031:15"/>
falls out unluckily for him) that a <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Shepherd di<U+017F>cover'd to the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> the <hi>Creation of the World.</hi> And what Subject more fit for <U+017F>uch a <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral,</hi> than that Great Affair which was fir<U+017F>t noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the World by one of that <hi>Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion?</hi> Nor does it appear, (what he takes for granted) that <hi>Virgil</hi> de<U+017F>cribes the Original of the World according to the <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is</hi> of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> he was too well <U+017F>een in Antiquity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <U+017F>uch a gro<U+017F>s Mi<U+017F>take; there is not the lea<U+017F>t mention of <hi>Chance</hi> in that whole pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, nor of the <hi>Clinamen Principiorum,</hi> <U+017F>o peculiar to <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s <hi>Hypothe<U+017F>is. Virgil</hi> had not only more Piety, but was of too nice a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to introduce a <hi>God</hi> denying the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> and <U+017F>inging a Hymn to the Atoms, and Blind Chance. On the contrary, his De<U+017F>cription agrees very well with that of <hi>Mo<U+017F>es;</hi> and the Learn'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator <hi>D'Acier,</hi> who is <U+017F>o confident that <hi>Horace</hi> had perus'd the Sacred Hi<U+017F>tory, might with greater Rea<U+017F>on have affirm'd the <U+017F>ame thing of <hi>Virgil.</hi> For, be<U+017F>ides that Famous Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age in the Sixth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> (by which this may be illu<U+017F>trated,) where the word <hi>Principio</hi> is us'd in the front of both by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and the <hi>Seas</hi> are fir<U+017F>t mention'd, and the <hi>Spiritus intus alit,</hi> which might not improbably, as Mr. <hi>D'Acier</hi> would <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>t, allude to the <hi>Spirit moving upon the face of the Waters;</hi> But omitting this paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel place, the <hi><U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ive</hi> formation of the World is evidently de<U+017F>crib'd in the<U+017F>e words,
<q>
                        <l>Rerum paulatim <U+017F>umere formas;</l>
                     </q>
And 'tis hardly po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to render more literally that ver<U+017F>e of <hi>Mo<U+017F>es,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let the Waters be gathered into one place, and let the dry Land appear,</hi> than in this of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Jam durare <U+017F>olum, &amp; di<U+017F>cludere Nerea Ponto.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this the formation of the Sun is de<U+017F>crib'd (exactly in the <hi>Mo<U+017F>aical</hi> order,) and next the production of the fir<U+017F>t Living Creatures, and that too in a <U+017F>mall number, (<U+017F>till in the <U+017F>ame method.)</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Rara per ignotos errent animalia montes.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And here the fore<U+017F>aid Author would probably remark, that <hi>Virgil</hi> keeps more exactly to the <hi>Mo<U+017F>aick</hi> Sy<U+017F>tem, than an Ingenious Writer, who will by no means allow Mountains to be <hi>coaeval</hi> with the World. Thus much will make it probable at lea<U+017F>t, that <hi>Virgil</hi> had <hi>Mo<U+017F>es</hi> in his thoughts rather than <hi>Epicurus,</hi> when he compos'd this Poem. But it is further remarkable, that this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age was taken from a Song attributed to <hi>Apollo,</hi> who him<U+017F>elf too <hi>unluckily</hi> had been a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and he took it from another yet more ancient, compos'd by the fir<U+017F>t <hi>Inventer</hi> of <hi>Mu<U+017F>ick,</hi> and at that time a <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi> too; and this is one of the Noble<U+017F>t Fragments of <hi>Greek</hi> Antiquity; and becau<U+017F>e I cannot <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the Ingenious Mr. <hi>F.</hi> one of their number, who pretend to cen<U+017F>ure the <hi>Greeks,</hi> without being able to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h <hi>Greek</hi> from <hi>Ephe<U+017F>ian Characters,</hi> I <U+017F>hall here <U+017F>et down the Lines from which <hi>Virgil</hi> took this pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, tho' none of the Commentators have ob<U+017F>erv'd it.</p>

The Fir<U+017F>t is, that an air of Piety upon all occa<U+017F>ions <U+017F>hould be maintain'd in the whole Poem: This appears in all the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Writers; as <hi>Homer,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Virgil</hi> is <U+017F>o exact in the ob<U+017F>ervation of it, not only in this Work, but in his <hi>Aeneis</hi> too, that a Celebrated <hi>French</hi> Writer taxes him for permitting <hi>Aeneas</hi> to do nothing without the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of <U+017F>ome God.

                  <p>A Fourth Rule, and of great importance in this delicate <U+017F>ort of Writing, is, that there be choice diver<U+017F>ity of Subjects; that the <hi>Eclogues,</hi> like a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Pro<U+017F>pect, <U+017F>hould Charm by its Variety. <hi>Virgil</hi> is admirable in this Point, and far <U+017F>urpa<U+017F><U+017F>es <hi>Theocritus,</hi> as he does every where, when Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Contrivance have the principal part.

Does not <hi>Fear, Ambition, Avarice, Pride,</hi> a Capricio of Honour, and <hi>Lazine<U+017F>s</hi> it <U+017F>elf often Triumph over <hi>Love?</hi> But this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion does all, not only in <hi>Pa<U+017F>torals,</hi> but on <hi>Modern Tragedies</hi> too. A Heroe can no more <hi>Fight, or</hi> be <hi>Sick,</hi> or <hi>Dye,</hi> than he can be <hi>Born</hi> without a <hi>Woman.</hi> But <hi>Dramatic's</hi> have been compos'd in compliance to the Humour of the Age, and the prevailing Inclination of the great, who<U+017F>e <hi>Example</hi> has a very powerful Influence, not only in the little Court behind the Scenes, but on the great Theatre of the World. This inundation of <hi>Love-Ver<U+017F>es</hi> 'tis not <U+017F>o much an effect of their Amorou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, as of immoderate <hi>Self-love.</hi> This being the only <U+017F>ort of Poetry, in which the Writer can, not only without Cen<U+017F>ure, but even with <hi>Commendation,</hi> talk of <hi>him<U+017F>elf.</hi> There is generally more of the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Narci<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> than concern for <hi>Chloris</hi> and <hi>Corinna</hi> in this whole Affair. Be pleas'd to look into almo<U+017F>t any of tho<U+017F>e Writers, and you <U+017F>hall meet every where that <hi>eternal Moy,</hi> which the admirable <hi>Pa<U+017F>chal</hi> <U+017F>o judiciou<U+017F>ly condemns. <hi>Homer</hi> can never be enough admir'd for this one <U+017F>o particular Quality, that he never <U+017F>peaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf, either in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> or the <hi>Ody<U+017F><U+017F>es;</hi> and if Horace had never told us his Genealogy, but left it to the Writer of his Life, perhaps he had not been a lo<U+017F>er by it. This Con<U+017F>ideration might induce tho<U+017F>e great Criticks, <hi>Varius</hi> and <hi>Tucca,</hi> to raze out the four fir<U+017F>t Ver<U+017F>es of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> in great mea<U+017F>ure, for the <U+017F>ake of that unlucky <hi>Ille ego.</hi> But extraordinary <hi>Genius's</hi> have a <U+017F>ort of Prerogative, which may di<U+017F>pence them from Laws, binding to <hi>Subject-Wits.</hi> However, the Ladies have the le<U+017F>s Rea<U+017F>on to be pleas'd with tho<U+017F>e Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F><U+017F>es, of which the Poet takes the greater <U+017F>hare to him<U+017F>elf. Thus the <hi>Beau</hi> pre<U+017F><U+017F>es into their <hi>Dre<U+017F><U+017F>ing-Room,</hi> but it is not <U+017F>o much to adore their fair Eyes, as to adju<U+017F>t his own Steenzkirk and Peruke, and <U+017F>et his Countenance in their Gla<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>A fifth Rule, (which one may hope will not be conte<U+017F>ted) is that the Writer <U+017F>hould <U+017F>hew in his Compo<U+017F>itions, <U+017F>ome competent skill of the Subject matter, that which makes the Character of the Per<U+017F>ons introduc'd. In this, as in all other Points of Learning, Decency, and Oeconomy of a Poem, <hi>Virgil</hi> much excells his Ma<U+017F>ter <hi>Theocritus.</hi> The <hi>Poet</hi> is better skill'd in <hi>Husbandry</hi> than tho<U+017F>e that get their Bread by <hi>it.</hi> He de<U+017F>cribes the Nature, the Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, the Remedies, the proper places, and Sea<U+017F>ons, of Feeding, of Watering their Flocks; the Furniture, Diet; the Lodging and pa<U+017F>times of his Shepherds. But the Per<U+017F>ons brought in by Mr. <hi>F.</hi> are Shepherds in Ma<U+017F>querade, and handle their <hi>Sheep-Hook</hi> as awkardly, as they do their <hi>Oaten-Reed.</hi> They Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about with their <hi>chers Moutons,</hi> but they relate as little to the Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s in hand, as the <hi>Painter's Dog,</hi> or a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship, does to the Hi<U+017F>tory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign'd. One would <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect <U+017F>ome of them, that in<U+017F>tead of leading out their Sheep
<pb facs="tcp:43031:17"/>
into the Plains of <hi>Mont-Bri<U+017F>on,</hi> and <hi>Marcilli,</hi> to the flowry Banks of <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> or the <hi>Charanthe;</hi> that they are driving directly, <hi>à la boucherie,</hi> to make Money of them. I hope hereafter Mr. <hi>F.</hi> will chu<U+017F>e his Servants better.</p>
                  <p>A <U+017F>ixth Rule is, That as the Style ought to be natural, clear, and elegant, it <U+017F>hould have <U+017F>ome peculiar reli<U+017F>h of the Ancient Fa<U+017F>hion of Writing. Parables in tho<U+017F>e times were frequently us'd, as they are <U+017F>till by the <hi>Ea<U+017F>tern</hi> Nations; Philo<U+017F>ophical Que<U+017F>tions, Aenigma's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of this we find In<U+017F>tances in the <hi>Sacred Writings,</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> Contemporary with King <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tragedians; this piece of Antiquity is imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by <hi>Virgil</hi> with great judgment and di<U+017F>cretion: He has propos'd one Riddle which has never yet been <U+017F>olv'd by any of his Commentators. Tho' he knew the Rules of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> as well as <hi>Cicero</hi> him<U+017F>elf; he conceals that skill in his Pa<U+017F>torals, and keeps clo<U+017F>e to the Character of Antiquity: Nor ought the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions and Tran<U+017F>itions to be very <U+017F>trict, and regular; this would give the <hi>Pa<U+017F>torals</hi> an Air of <hi>Novelty,</hi> and of this neglect of exact Connexions, we have in<U+017F>tances in the Writings of the Ancient <hi>Chine<U+017F>es,</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> in <hi>Pindar,</hi> and other Writers of <hi>Dithyrambics,</hi> in th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Chorus<hi>'s</hi> of <hi>Ae<U+017F>chylus, Sophocles,</hi> and <hi>Euripides.</hi> If Mr. <hi>F.</hi> and <hi>Ruaeus,</hi> had con<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd this, the one wou'd have <U+017F>par'd his Critic of the Sixth, and the other, his Reflections upon the Ninth <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral.</hi> The over-<U+017F>crupulous care of Connexions, makes the Modern Compo<U+017F>itions oftentimes tedious and flat: And by the omi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion of them it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that the <hi>Pen<U+017F>ees</hi> of the incomparable <hi>Mr. Pa<U+017F>cal,</hi> and perhaps of Mr. <hi>Bruyere,</hi> are two of the mo<U+017F>t Entertaining Books which the Modern <hi>French</hi> can boa<U+017F>t of. <hi>Virgil,</hi> in this point, was not only faithful to the Character of Antiquity, but Copies after <hi>Nature</hi> her <U+017F>elf. Thus <hi>a Meadow,</hi> where the Beauties of the Spring are <hi>profu<U+017F>ely</hi> blended together, makes a more delightful Pro<U+017F>pect, than a curious Knot of <U+017F>orted Flowers in our Gardens; and we are much more tran<U+017F>ported with the Beauty of the Heavens, and admiration of their Creator, in a clear Night, when we behold Stars of all <hi>Magnitudes, promi<U+017F>cuou<U+017F>ly</hi> moving together, than if tho<U+017F>e glorious Lights were rank'd in their <U+017F>everal <hi>Orders,</hi> or reduc'd into the fine<U+017F>t <hi>Geometrical</hi> Figures.</p>
                  <p>Another Rule omitted by <hi>P. Rapine,</hi> as <U+017F>ome of his are by me, (for I do not de<U+017F>ign an entire Treati<U+017F>e in this Preface,) is, that not only the Sentences <U+017F>hould be <hi><U+017F>hort,</hi> and <hi><U+017F>mart,</hi> upon which account, he ju<U+017F>tly blames the <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> as too Talkative, but that the whole piece <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o too. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> transgre<U+017F>s'd this Rule in his fir<U+017F>t Pa<U+017F>torals, I mean tho<U+017F>e which he compos'd at <hi>Mantua,</hi> but rectifi'd the Fault in his Riper Years. This appears by the <hi>Culex,</hi> which is as long as five of his Pa<U+017F>torals put together. The greater part of tho<U+017F>e he fini<U+017F>h'd, have le<U+017F>s than a Hundred Ver<U+017F>es, and but two of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that Number. But the <hi>Silenus,</hi> which he <U+017F>eems to have de<U+017F>ign'd for his Ma<U+017F>ter-piece, in which he introduces a God <U+017F>inging, and he too full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>piration, (which is intended by that ebriety, which Mr. <hi>F.</hi> <U+017F>o unrea<U+017F>onably ridicules,) tho' it go thro' <U+017F>o va<U+017F>t a Field of Matter, and comprizes the Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of near Two Thou<U+017F>and Years, con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts but of <hi>Fifty</hi> Lines; <U+017F>o that its bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is no le<U+017F>s admirable, than the <U+017F>ubject Matter; the noble Fa<U+017F>hion of handling it, and the <hi>Deity</hi> <U+017F>peaking. <hi>Virgil</hi> keeps up his Characters in this re<U+017F>pect too, with the <U+017F>tricte<U+017F>t decency: For Poetry and Pa<U+017F>time was not the Bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of Mens Lives in tho<U+017F>e days, but only their <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable Recreation after nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary Labours. And therefore the length of <U+017F>ome of the Modern <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Compo<U+017F>itions, is again<U+017F>t the Rules of this kind of Poe<U+017F>y.</p>

I <U+017F>hall add <U+017F>omething very briefly touching the Ver<U+017F>ification of <hi>Pa<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> tho' it be a mortifying Con<U+017F>ideration to the Moderns. Heroic Ver<U+017F>e, as it is commonly call'd, was us'd by the <hi>Latins</hi> in this <U+017F>ort of Poem, as very Ancient and Natural. <hi>Lyrics, Iambics, &amp;c.</hi> being Invented afterwards: but there is <U+017F>o great a difference in the Numbers, of which it may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that it may pa<U+017F>s rather for a <hi>Genus,</hi> than <hi>Species,</hi> of Ver<U+017F>e. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oever <U+017F>hall compare the <hi>numbers</hi> of the three following Ver<U+017F>es, will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of the truth of this Ob<U+017F>ervation.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Sound</hi> of the Ver<U+017F>es, is almo<U+017F>t as different as the <hi>Subjects.</hi> But the <hi>Greek</hi> Writers of <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral,</hi> u<U+017F>ually limited them<U+017F>elves to the Example of the fir<U+017F>t; which <hi>Virgil</hi> found <U+017F>o exceedingly difficult, that he quitted it, and left the Honour of that part to <hi>Theocritus.</hi> It is indeed probable, that what we improperly call <hi>rhyme,</hi> is the mo<U+017F>t Ancient <U+017F>ort of Poetry; and Learned Men have given good Arguments for it; and therefore a <hi>French</hi> Hi<U+017F>torian commits a gro<U+017F>s mi<U+017F>take, when he attributes that Invention to a King of <hi>Gaul,</hi> as an <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Gentleman does, when he makes a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor of it. But the <hi>Greeks</hi> who under<U+017F>tood fully the force and power of <hi>Numbers,</hi> <U+017F>oon grew weary of this Childi<U+017F>h <U+017F>ort of Ver<U+017F>e, as the Younger <hi>Vo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ius</hi> ju<U+017F>tly calls it, and therefore tho<U+017F>e rhyming Hexameters, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> ob<U+017F>erves in <hi>Homer him<U+017F>elf,</hi> <U+017F>eem to be the Remains of a barbarous Age. <hi>Virgil</hi> had them in <U+017F>uch abhorrence, that he would rather make a fal<U+017F>e <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax,</hi> than what we call a Rhime, <U+017F>uch a Ver<U+017F>e as this

So that the principal Ornament of Modern Poetry, was accounted <hi>deformity</hi> by the <hi>Latins,</hi> and <hi>Greeks;</hi> it was they who invented the different termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of words, tho<U+017F>e happy compo<U+017F>itions, tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>hort mono<U+017F>yllables, tho<U+017F>e tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>itions for the elegance of the <U+017F>ound and <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, which are wanting <U+017F>o much in modern Languages. The <hi>French</hi> <U+017F>ometimes crowd together ten, or twelve Mono<U+017F>yllables, into one disjoynted Ver<U+017F>e; they may under<U+017F>tand the nature of, but cannot imitate, tho<U+017F>e wonderful <hi>Spondees</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> by which he could <U+017F>uddenly pacifie a Man that was in a violent tran<U+017F>port of anger; nor tho<U+017F>e <hi><U+017F>wift numbers</hi> of the Prie<U+017F>ts of <hi>Cybele,</hi> which had the force to enrage the mo<U+017F>t <hi><U+017F>edate</hi> and <hi>Phlegmatick</hi> Tempers. Nor can any Modern put into his own Language the <hi>Energy</hi> of that <U+017F>ingle Poem of <hi>Catullus,</hi>

Latin is but a corrupt dialect of <hi>Greek;</hi> and the <hi>French, Spani<U+017F>h,</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> a corruption of <hi>Latine;</hi> and therefore a Man might as well go about to per<U+017F>uade me that <hi>Vinegar</hi> is a <hi>Nobler</hi> Liquor than <hi>Wine,</hi> as that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Compo<U+017F>itions can be as graceful and harmonious as the <hi>Latine</hi> it <U+017F>elf.

                  <p>Ours and the <hi>French</hi> can at be<U+017F>t but fall into Blank Ver<U+017F>e, which is a fault in Pro<U+017F>e. The misfortune indeed is common to us both, but we de<U+017F>erve more compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, becau<U+017F>e we are not vain of our Barbarities.

                  <p>The Judicious <hi>Malherbe</hi> exploded this <U+017F>ort of Ver<U+017F>e near Eighty Years ago. Nor can I forbear wondering at that pa<U+017F><U+017F>age of a Famous Academician, in which he, mo<U+017F>t compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately, excu<U+017F>es the Ancients for their not being <U+017F>o exact in their Compo<U+017F>itions, as the Modern <hi>French,</hi> becau<U+017F>e they wanted <hi>a Dictionary,</hi> of which the <hi>French</hi> are at la<U+017F>t happily provided. If <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Demo<U+017F>thenes</hi> had been <U+017F>o lucky as to have had a <hi>Dictionary,</hi> and <U+017F>uch a Patron as Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> perhaps they might have a<U+017F>pir'd to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Balzac</hi>'s Legacy of <hi>Ten Pounds, Le prix de l'Eloquence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the contrary, I dare a<U+017F><U+017F>ert that there are hardly ten Lines in either of tho<U+017F>e great Orators, or even in the Catalogue of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Ships, which is not more harmonious, more truly <hi>Rythmical,</hi> than mo<U+017F>t of the <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<U+017F>h</hi> Sonnets; and therefore they lo<U+017F>e, at lea<U+017F>t, one half of their native Beauty by Tran<U+017F>lation.</p>

Seven Years together I have conceal'd the longing which I had to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you: A time as tedious as <hi>Aeneas</hi> pa<U+017F>s'd in his wandring Voyage, before he reach'd the promis'd <hi>Italy.</hi> But I con<U+017F>ider'd, that nothing which my meanne<U+017F>s cou'd produce, was worthy of your Patronage. At la<U+017F>t this happy Occa<U+017F>ion offer'd, of Pre<U+017F>enting to you the be<U+017F>t Poem of the be<U+017F>t Poet. If I balk'd this opportunity, I was in de<U+017F>pair of finding <U+017F>uch another; and if I took it, I was <U+017F>till uncertain whether you wou'd vouch<U+017F>afe to accept it from my hands. 'Twas a bold venture which I made, in de<U+017F>iring your permi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion to lay my unworthy Labours at your feet. But my ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s has <U+017F>uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded beyond my hopes: And you have been pleas'd not to <U+017F>uffer an Old Man to go di<U+017F>contented out of the World, for want of that protection, of which he had been <U+017F>o long Ambitious. I have known a Gentleman in di<U+017F>grace, and not daring to appear before King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, though he much de<U+017F>ir'd it: At length he took the confidence to attend a fair Lady to the Court; and told His Maje<U+017F>ty, that under her protection he had pre<U+017F>um'd to wait on him. With the <U+017F>ame humble confidence I pre<U+017F>ent my <U+017F>elf before your Lord<U+017F>hip, and attending on <hi>Virgil</hi> hope a gracious reception. The Gentleman <U+017F>ucceeded, becau<U+017F>e the powerful Lady was his Friend; but I have too much injur'd my great Author, to expect he <U+017F>hould intercede for me. I wou'd have Tran<U+017F>lated him, but according to the litteral <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Phra<U+017F>es, I fear I have traduc'd him. 'Tis the fault of many a well-meaning Man, to be officious in a wrong place, and do a prejudice, where he had endeavour'd to do a <U+017F>ervice. <hi>Virgil</hi> wrote his <hi>Georgics</hi> in the full <U+017F>trength and vigour of his Age, when his Judgment was at the height, and before his Fancy was declining. He had, (according to our homely Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) his full <U+017F>wing at this Poem, beginning it about the Age of Thirty Five; and <U+017F>carce concluding it before he arriv'd at Forty. 'Tis ob<U+017F>erv'd both of him, and <hi>Horace,</hi> and I believe it will hold in all great Poets; that though they wrote before with a certain heat of Genius which in<U+017F>pir'd them, yet that heat was not perfectly dige<U+017F>ted. There is requir'd a continuance of warmth to ripen the be<U+017F>t and Noble<U+017F>t Fruits. Thus <hi>Horace</hi> in his Fir<U+017F>t and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

Book of <hi>Odes,</hi> was <U+017F>till ri<U+017F>ing, but came not to his <hi>Meridian</hi> 'till the Third. After which his Judgment was an overpoize to his Imagination: He grew too cautious to be bold enough, for he de<U+017F>cended in his Fourth by <U+017F>low degrees, and in his <hi>Satires</hi> and <hi>Epi<U+017F>tles,</hi> was more a Philo<U+017F>opher and a Critick than a Poet. In the beginning of Summer the days are almo<U+017F>t at a <U+017F>tand, with little variation of length or <U+017F>hortne<U+017F>s, becau<U+017F>e at that time the Diurnal Motion of the Sun partakes more of a Right Line, than of a Spiral. The <U+017F>amè is the method of Nature in the frame of Man. He <U+017F>eems at Forty to be fully in his Summer Tropick; <U+017F>omewhat before, and <U+017F>omewhat after, he finds in his Soul but <U+017F>mall increa<U+017F>es or decays. From Fifty to Three<U+017F>core the Ballance generally holds even, in our colder Clymates: For he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es not much in Fancy; and Judgment, which is the effect of Ob<U+017F>ervation, <U+017F>till increa<U+017F>es: His <U+017F>ucceeding years afford him little more than the <U+017F>tubble of his own Harve<U+017F>t: Yet if his Con<U+017F>titution be healthful, his Mind may <U+017F>till retain a decent vigour; and the Gleanings of that <hi>Ephraim,</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari<U+017F>on with others, will <U+017F>urpa<U+017F>s the Vintage of <hi>Abiezer.</hi> I have call'd this <U+017F>omewhere by a bold Metaphor, a green Old Age; but <hi>Virgil</hi> has given me his Authority for the Figure.</p>

                  <p>Amongst tho<U+017F>e few who enjoy the advantage of a latter Spring, your Lord<U+017F>hip is a rare Example: Who being now arriv'd at your great <hi>Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macterique,</hi> yet give no proof of the lea<U+017F>t decay in your Excellent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and comprehen<U+017F>ion of all things, which are within the compa<U+017F>s of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nder<U+017F>tanding. Your Conver<U+017F>ation is as ea<U+017F>ie as it is in<U+017F>tructive, and I cou'd never ob<U+017F>erve the lea<U+017F>t vanity or the lea<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>uming in any thing you <U+017F>aid: but a natural unaffected Mode<U+017F>ty, full of good <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, and well dige<U+017F>ted. A clearne<U+017F>s of Notion, expre<U+017F>s'd in ready and un<U+017F>tudied words. No Man has complain'd, or ever can, that you have di<U+017F>cours'd too long on any Subject: for you leave us in an eagerne<U+017F>s of Learning more; pleas'd with what we hear, but not <U+017F>atisfy'd, becau<U+017F>e you will not <U+017F>peak <U+017F>o much as we cou'd wi<U+017F>h. I dare not excu<U+017F>e your Lord<U+017F>hip from this fault; for though 'tis none in you, 'tis one to all who have the happine<U+017F>s of being known to you. I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s the Criticks make it one of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Beauties, that having <U+017F>aid what he thought convenient, he always left <U+017F>omewhat for the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Readers to <U+017F>upply: That they might gratifie their fancies, by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more, in what he had written, than at fir<U+017F>t they cou'd; and think they had added to his thought, when it was all there before-hand, and he only <U+017F>av'd him<U+017F>elf the expence of words. However it was, I never went from your Lord<U+017F>hip, but with a longing to return, or without a hearty Cur<U+017F>e to him who invented Ceremonies in the World, and put me on the nec<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap><U+017F><U+017F>ity of withdrawing, when it was my intere<U+017F>t as well as my de<U+017F>ire, to have given you a much longer trouble. I cannot imagine (if your Lord<U+017F>hip will give me leave to <U+017F>peak my thoughts) but you have had a more than ordinary vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in your Youth. For too much of heat is requir'd at fir<U+017F>t, that there may not too little be left at la<U+017F>t. A Prodigal Fire is only capable of large remains: And yours, my Lord, <U+017F>till burns the clearer in declining. The Blaze is not <U+017F>o fierce as at the fir<U+017F>t, but the Smoak is wholly vani<U+017F>h'd; and your Friends who <U+017F>tand about you, are not only <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of a chearful warmth, but are kept at an awful di<U+017F>tance by its force. In my <U+017F>mall Ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of Mankind, I have ever <U+017F>ound, that <U+017F>uch as are not rather too full of Spirit when they are young, degenerate to dullne<U+017F>s in their Age. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety in our riper years is the effect of a well-concocted warmth; but where

the Principles are only Phlegm, what can be expected from the wateri<U+017F>h Matter, but an in<U+017F>ipid Manhood, and a <U+017F>tupid old Infancy; Di<U+017F>cretion in Leading-<U+017F>trings, and a confirm'd ignorance on Crutches? <hi>Virgil</hi> in his Third <hi>Georgic,</hi> when he de<U+017F>cribes a Colt, who promi<U+017F>es a Cour<U+017F>er for the Race, or for the Field of Battel, <U+017F>hews him the fir<U+017F>t to pa<U+017F>s the Bridge, which trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles under him, and to <U+017F>tem the torrent of the flood. His beginnings mu<U+017F>t be in ra<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s; a Noble Fault: But Time and Experience will correct that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and tame it into a deliberate and well-weigh'd Courage; which knows both to be cautious and to dare, as occa<U+017F>ion offers. Your Lord<U+017F>hip is a Man of Honour, not only <U+017F>o un<U+017F>tain'd, but <U+017F>o unque<U+017F>tion'd, that you are the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Standard of that Heroick Vertue; <U+017F>o truly <U+017F>uch, that if I wou'd flatter you, I cou'd not. It takes not from you, that you were born with Principles of Genero<U+017F>ity and Probity: But it adds to you, that you have cultivated Nature, and made tho<U+017F>e Principles, the Rule and Mea<U+017F>ure of all your Actions. The World knows this, without my telling: Yet Poets have a right of Recording it to all Po<U+017F>terity.

                  <p>To be Nobly Born, and of an Ancient Family, is in the extreams of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, either good or bad; for Virtue and De<U+017F>cent are no Inheritance.

But to pre<U+017F>erve this whitene<U+017F>s in its Original Purity, you, my Lord, have, like that Ermine, for<U+017F>aken the common Track of Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s, which is not always clean: You have cho<U+017F>en for your <U+017F>elf a private Greatne<U+017F>s, and will not be polluted with Ambition. It has been ob<U+017F>erv'd in former times, that none have been <U+017F>o greedy of Employments, and of managing the Publick, as they who have lea<U+017F>t de<U+017F>erv'd their Stations. But <U+017F>uch only merit to be call'd Patriots, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom we <U+017F>ee their Country Flouri<U+017F>h. I have laugh'd <U+017F>ometimes (for who wou'd always be a <hi>Heraclitus?)</hi> when I have reflected on tho<U+017F>e Men, who from time to time have <U+017F>hot them<U+017F>elves into the World. I have <U+017F>een many Succe<U+017F><U+017F>ions of them; <U+017F>ome bolting out upon the Stage with va<U+017F>t applau<U+017F>e, and others hi<U+017F>s'd off, and quitting it with di<U+017F>grace. But while they were in action, I have con<U+017F>tantly ob<U+017F>erv'd, that they <U+017F>eem'd de<U+017F>irous to retreat from Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s: Greatne<U+017F>s they <U+017F>aid was nau<U+017F>eous, and a Crowd was trouble<U+017F>ome; a quiet privacy was their Ambition. Some few of them I believe <U+017F>aid this in earne<U+017F>t, and were making a provi<U+017F>ion again<U+017F>t future want, that they might enjoy their Age with ea<U+017F>e: They <U+017F>aw the happine<U+017F>s of a private Life, and promis'd to them<U+017F>elves a Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing, which every day it was in their power to po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s. But they deferr'd it, and linger'd <U+017F>till at Court, becau<U+017F>e they thought they had not yet enough to make them happy: They wou'd have more, and laid in to make their Solitude Luxurious. A wretched Philo<U+017F>ophy, which <hi>Epicurus</hi> never taught them in his Garden: They lov'd the pro<U+017F>pect of this

quiet in rever<U+017F>ion, but were not willing to have it in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion; they wou'd fir<U+017F>t be Old, and made as <U+017F>ure of Health and Life, as if both of them were at their di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>e. But put them to the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of a pre<U+017F>ent choice, and they preferr'd continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Power: Like the Wretch who call'd Death to his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance, but refus'd it when he came. The Great <hi>Scipio</hi> was not of their Opinion, who indeed <U+017F>ought Honours in his Youth, and indur'd the Fatigues with which he purchas'd them. He <U+017F>erv'd his Country when it was in need of his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and his Conduct, 'till he thought it was time to <U+017F>erve him<U+017F>elf: But di<U+017F>mounted from the Saddle, when he found the Bea<U+017F>t which bore him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow re<U+017F>tiff and ungovernable. But your Lord<U+017F>hip has given us a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Example of Moderation. You <U+017F>aw betimes that Ingratitude is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to Commonwealths; and therefore though you were form'd alike, for the greate<U+017F>t of Civil Employments, and Military Commands, yet you pu<U+017F>h'd not your Fortune to ri<U+017F>e in either; but contented your <U+017F>elf with being capable, as much as any who<U+017F>oever, of defending your Country with your Sword, or a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting it with your Coun<U+017F>el, when you were call'd. For the re<U+017F>t, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect and love which was paid you, not only in the Province where you live, but generally by all who had the happine<U+017F>s to know you, was a wi<U+017F>e Exchange for the Honours of the Court: A place of forgetfulne<U+017F>s, at the be<U+017F>t, for well de<U+017F>ervers. 'Tis nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for the poli<U+017F>hing of Manners, to have breath'd that Air, but 'tis infectious even to the be<U+017F>t Morals to live always in it. 'Tis a dangerous Commerce, where an hone<U+017F>t Man is <U+017F>ure at the fir<U+017F>t of being Cheated; and he recovers not his Lo<U+017F><U+017F>es, but by learning to Cheat others. The undermining Smile becomes at length habitual; and the drift of his plau<U+017F>ible Conver<U+017F>ation, is only to flatter one, that he may betray another. Yet 'tis good to have been a looker on, without venturing to play; that a Man may know fal<U+017F>e Dice another time, though he never means to u<U+017F>e them. I commend not him who never knew a Court, but him who for<U+017F>akes it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e he knows it. A young Man de<U+017F>erves no prai<U+017F>e, who out of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Zeal leaves the World before he has well try'd it, and runs headlong into Religion. He who carries a Maidenhead into a Cloy<U+017F>ter, is <U+017F>ometimes apt to lo<U+017F>e it there, and to repent of his Repentance. He only is like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Au<U+017F>terities, who has already found the inconvenience of Plea<U+017F>ures. For almo<U+017F>t every Man will be making Experiments in one part or another of his Life: And the danger is the le<U+017F>s when we are young: For having try'd it early, we <U+017F>hall not be apt to repeat it afterwards. Your Lord<U+017F>hip therefore may properly be <U+017F>aid to have cho<U+017F>en a Retreat; and not to have cho<U+017F>en it 'till you had maturely weigh'd the advantages of ri<U+017F>ing higher with the hazards of the fall. <hi>Res non parta labore, <U+017F>ed relicta,</hi> was thought by a Poet, to be one of the requi<U+017F>ites to a happy Life. Why <U+017F>hou'd a rea<U+017F>onable Man put it into the power of Fortune to make him mi<U+017F>erable, when his Ance<U+017F>tours have taken care to relea<U+017F>e him from her? Let him venture, <U+017F>ays <hi>Horace, Qui Zonam perdidit.</hi> He who has nothing, plays <U+017F>ecurely, for he may win, and cannot be poorer if he lo<U+017F>es. But he who is born to a plentiful E<U+017F>tate, and is Ambitious of Offices at Court, <U+017F>ets a <U+017F>take to Fortune, which <U+017F>he can <U+017F>eldom an<U+017F>wer: If he gains nothing, he lo<U+017F>es all, or part of what was once his own; and if he gets, he cannot be certain but he may refund.</p>
                  <p>In <U+017F>hort, however he <U+017F>ucceeds, 'tis Covetou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s that induc'd him fir<U+017F>t to play, and Covetou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s is the undoubted <U+017F>ign of ill <U+017F>en<U+017F>e at bottom. The Odds are again<U+017F>t him that he lo<U+017F>es, and one lo<U+017F>s may be of more con<U+017F>equence to him, than all his former winnings. 'Tis like the pre<U+017F>ent War of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tians</hi> again<U+017F>t the <hi>Turk;</hi> every year they gain a Victory, and by that a Town; but if they are once defeated, they lo<U+017F>e a Province at a blow, and endanger the <U+017F>afety of the whole Empire. You, my Lord, enjoy your quiet in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,

                  <p>
                     <hi>VIRGIL</hi> may be reckon'd the fir<U+017F>t who introduc'd three new kinds of Poetry among the <hi>Romans,</hi> which he Copied after three the Greate<U+017F>t Ma<U+017F>ters of <hi>Greece. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> have <U+017F>till di<U+017F>puted for the advantage over him in <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral</hi> and <hi>Heroicks,</hi> but I think all are Unanimous in giving him the precedence to <hi>He<U+017F>iod</hi> in his <hi>Georgies.</hi> The truth of it is, the Sweetne<U+017F>s and Ru<U+017F>ticity of a <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral</hi> cannot be <U+017F>o well expre<U+017F>t in any other Tongue as in the <hi>Greek,</hi> when rightly mixt and qualified with the <hi>Doric</hi> Dialect; nor can the Maje<U+017F>ty of an Heroick Poem any where appear <U+017F>o well as in this Language, which has a Natural greatne<U+017F>s in it, and can be often render'd more deep and <U+017F>onorous by the Pronunciation of the <hi>Ionians.</hi> But in the middle Stile, where the Writers in both Tongues are on a Level: we <U+017F>ee how far <hi>Virgil</hi> has excell'd all who have written in the <U+017F>ame way with him.</p>
                  <p>There has been abundance of Critici<U+017F>m <U+017F>pent on <hi>Virgil's Pa<U+017F>torals</hi> and <hi>Aeneids,</hi> but the <hi>Georgics</hi> are a Subject which none of the <hi>Criticks</hi> have <U+017F>ufficiently taken into their Con<U+017F>ideration; mo<U+017F>t of 'em pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing it over in <U+017F>ilence, or ca<U+017F>ting it under the <U+017F>ame head with <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral;</hi> a divi<U+017F>ion by no means proper, unle<U+017F>s we <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the Stile of a Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman ought to be imitated in a <hi>Georgic</hi> as that of a Shepherd is in <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral.</hi> But tho' the Scene of both the<U+017F>e Poems lies in the <U+017F>ame place; the Speakers in them are of a quite different Character, <U+017F>ince the Precepts of Husbandry are not to be deliver'd with the <U+017F>implicity of a Plow-Man, but with the Addre<U+017F>s of a Poet. No Rules therefore that relate to <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral,</hi> can any way affect the <hi>Georgics,</hi> which fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Cla<U+017F>s of Poetry which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts in giving plain and direct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructions to the Reader; whether they be Moral Duties, as tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Theognis</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> or Philo<U+017F>ophical Speculations, as tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Lucretius;</hi> or Rules of Practice, as tho<U+017F>e of <hi>He<U+017F>iod</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> Among the<U+017F>e different kinds of Subjects, that which the <hi>Georgics</hi> goes upon, is I think the meane<U+017F>t and the lea<U+017F>t improving, but the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ing and delightful. Precepts of Morality, be<U+017F>ides the Natural Corruption of our Tempers, which makes us aver<U+017F>e to them, are <U+017F>o ab<U+017F>tracted from Ideas of Sen<U+017F>e, that they <U+017F>eldom give an
<pb facs="tcp:43031:65"/>
opportunity for tho<U+017F>e Beautiful De<U+017F>criptions and Images which are the Spirit and Life of Poetry. Natural Philo<U+017F>ophy has indeed <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible Objects to work upon, but then it often puzzles the Reader with the Intricacy of its Notions, and perplexes him with the multitude of its Di<U+017F>putes. But this kind of Poetry I am now <U+017F>peaking of, addre<U+017F><U+017F>es it <U+017F>elf wholly to the Imagination: It is altogether Conver<U+017F>ant among the Fields and Woods, and has the mo<U+017F>t delightful part of Nature for its Province. It rai<U+017F>es in our Minds a plea<U+017F>ing variety of Scenes and Landskips, whil<U+017F>t it teaches us: and makes the drye<U+017F>t of its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts look like a De<U+017F>cription. <hi>A</hi> Georgic <hi>therefore is <U+017F>ome part of the Science of Husbandry put into a plea<U+017F>ing Dre<U+017F>s, and <U+017F>et off with all the Beauties and Embelli<U+017F>hments of Poetry.</hi> Now <U+017F>ince this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Husbandry is of a very large extent, the Poet <U+017F>hews his Skill in <U+017F>ingling out <U+017F>uch Precepts to preceed on, as are u<U+017F>eful, and at the <U+017F>ame time mo<U+017F>t capable of Ornament. <hi>Virgil</hi> was <U+017F>o well acquainted with this Secret, that to <U+017F>et off his fir<U+017F>t <hi>Georgic,</hi> he has run into a <U+017F>et of Precepts, which are almo<U+017F>t foreign to his Subject, in that Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful account he gives us of the Signs in Nature, which precede the Changes of the Weather.</p>
                  <p>And if there be <U+017F>o much Art in the choice of fit Precepts, there is much more requir'd in the Treating of 'em; that they may fall in after each other by a Natural unforc'd Method, and <U+017F>hew them<U+017F>elves in the be<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t advantagious Light. They <U+017F>hou'd all be <U+017F>o finely wrought together into the <U+017F>ame Piece, that no cour<U+017F>e Seam may di<U+017F>cover where they joyn; as in a Curious Brede of Needle-Work, one Colour falls away by <U+017F>uch ju<U+017F>t degrees, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ri<U+017F>es <U+017F>o in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly, that we <U+017F>ee the variety, without being able to di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h the total vani<U+017F>hing of the one from the fir<U+017F>t appearance of the other. Nor is it <U+017F>ufficient to range and di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e this Body of Precepts into a clear and ea<U+017F>ie Method, unle<U+017F>s they are deliver'd to us in the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ing and agreeable manner: For there are <U+017F>everal ways of conveying the <U+017F>ame Truth to the Mind of Man, and to chu<U+017F>e the plea<U+017F>ante<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e ways, is that which chiefly di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hes Poetry from Pro<U+017F>e, and makes <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Rules of Husbandry plea<U+017F>anter to read than <hi>Varro</hi>'s. Where the Pro<U+017F>e-writer tells us plainly what ought to be done, the Poet often conceals the Precept in a de<U+017F>cription, and repre<U+017F>ents his Country-Man performing the Action in which he wou'd in<U+017F>truct his Reader. Where the one <U+017F>ets out as fully and di<U+017F>tinctly as he can, all the parts of the Truth, which he wou'd communicate to us; the other <U+017F>ingles out the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ing Circum<U+017F>tance of this Truth, and <U+017F>o conveys the whole in a more diverting manner to the Under<U+017F>tanding. I <U+017F>hall give one In<U+017F>tance out of a multitude of this nature, that might be found in the <hi>Georgics,</hi> where the Reader may <U+017F>ee the different ways <hi>Virgil</hi> has taken to expre<U+017F>s the <U+017F>ame thing, and how much plea<U+017F>anter every manner of Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion is, than the plain and direct mention of it wou'd have been. It is in the Second <hi>Georgic</hi> where he tells us what Trees will bear Grafting on each other.</p>

                  <p>Here we <U+017F>ee the Poet con<U+017F>ider'd all the Effects of this Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Trees of different kinds, and took notice of that Effect which had the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>urprize, and by con<U+017F>equence the mo<U+017F>t delight in it, to expre<U+017F>s the capacity that was in them of being thus united. This way of Writing is every where much in u<U+017F>e among the Poets, and is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly practis'd by <hi>Virgil,</hi> who loves to <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>t a Truth indirectly, and without giving us a full and open view of it: To let us <U+017F>ee ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much as will naturally lead the Imagination into all the parts that lie conceal'd. This is wonderfully diverting to the Under<U+017F>tanding, thus to receive a Precept, that enters as it were through a By-way, and to apprehend an Idea that draws a whole train after it: For here the Mind, which is always delighted with its own Di<U+017F>coveries, only takes the hint from the Poet, and <U+017F>eems to work out the re<U+017F>t by the <U+017F>trength of her own faculties.</p>
                  <p>But <U+017F>ince the inculcating Precept upon Precept, will at length prove tire<U+017F>om to the Reader, if he meets with no other Entertainment, the Poet mu<U+017F>t take care not to encumber his Poem with too much Bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; but <U+017F>ometimes to relieve the Subject with a Moral Reflection, or let it re<U+017F>t a while for the <U+017F>ake of a plea<U+017F>ant and pertinent digre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion. Nor is it <U+017F>ufficient to run out into beautiful and diverting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<U+017F><U+017F>ions (as it is generally thought) unle<U+017F>s they are brought in aptly, and are <U+017F>omething of a piece with the main de<U+017F>ign of the <hi>Georgic:</hi> for they ought to have a remote alliance at lea<U+017F>t to the Subject, that <U+017F>o the whole Poem may be more uniform and agreeable in all its parts. We <U+017F>hou'd never quite lo<U+017F>e <U+017F>ight of the Country, tho' we are <U+017F>ometimes entertain'd with a di<U+017F>tant pro<U+017F>pect of it. Of this nature are <hi>Virgil</hi>'s De<U+017F>criptions of the Original of <hi>Agriculture,</hi> of the Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne<U+017F>s of <hi>Italy,</hi> of a Country Life, and the like, which are not brought in by force, but naturally ri<U+017F>e out of the principal Argument and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign of the Poem. I know no one digre<U+017F><U+017F>ion in the <hi>Georgics</hi> that may <U+017F>eem to contradict this Ob<U+017F>ervation, be<U+017F>ides that in the latter end of the Fir<U+017F>t Book, where the Poet launches out into a di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e of the Battel of <hi>Phar<U+017F>alia,</hi> and the Actions of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus:</hi> But it's worth while to con<U+017F>ider how admirably he has turn'd the cour<U+017F>e of his narration into its proper Channel, and made his Husbandman concern'd even in what relates to the Battel, in tho<U+017F>e inimitable Lines,

We now come to the Stile which is proper to a <hi>Georgic;</hi> and indeed this is the part on which the Poet mu<U+017F>t lay out all his <U+017F>trength, that his words may be warm and glowing, and that every thing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cribes may immediately pre<U+017F>ent it <U+017F>elf, and ri<U+017F>e up to the Reader's view. He ought in particular to be careful of not letting his Subject deba<U+017F>e his Stile, and betray him into a meanne<U+017F>s of Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, but every where to keep up his Ver<U+017F>e in all the Pomp of Numbers, and Dignity of words.</p>
                  <p>I think nothing which is a Phra<U+017F>e or Sayingin common talk, <U+017F>hou'd be admitted into a <U+017F>erious Poem: becau<U+017F>e it takes off from the Solemnity of the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and gives it too great a turn of Familiarity: much le<U+017F>s ought the low Phra<U+017F>es and Terms of Art, that are adapted to Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, have any place in <U+017F>uch a Work as the <hi>Georgic,</hi> which is not to appear in the natural <U+017F>implicity and nakedne<U+017F>s of its Subject, but in the plea<U+017F>ante<U+017F>t Dre<U+017F>s that Poetry can be<U+017F>tow on it. Thus <hi>Virgil,</hi> to deviate from the common form of words, wou'd not make u<U+017F>e of <hi>Tempore</hi> but <hi>Sidere</hi> in his fir<U+017F>t Ver<U+017F>e, and every where el<U+017F>e a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with <hi>Metaphors, Greci<U+017F>ms,</hi> and <hi>Circumlocutions,</hi> to give his Ver<U+017F>e the greater Pomp, and pre<U+017F>erve it from <U+017F>inking into a <hi>Plebeian</hi> Stile. And herein con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ts <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Ma<U+017F>ter-piece, who has not only excell'd all other Poets, but even him<U+017F>elf in the Language of his <hi>Georgics;</hi> where we receive more <U+017F>trong and lively <hi>Ideas</hi> of things from his words, than we cou'd have done from the Objects them<U+017F>elves: and find our Imaginations more affected by his De<U+017F>criptions, than they wou'd have been by the very <U+017F>ight of what he de<U+017F>cribes.</p>
                  <p>I <U+017F>hall now, after this <U+017F>hort Scheme of Rules, con<U+017F>ider the different <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s that <hi>He<U+017F>iod</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have met with in this kind of Poetry, which may give us <U+017F>ome further Notion of the Excellence of the <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gics.</hi> To begin with <hi>He<U+017F>iod;</hi> If we may gue<U+017F>s at his Character from his Writings, he had much more of the Husbandman than the Poet in his Temper: He was wonderfully Grave, Di<U+017F>creet, and Frugal, he liv'd altogether in the Country, and was probably for his great Prudence the Oracle of the whole Neighbourhood. The<U+017F>e Principles of good Husbandry ran through his Works, and directed him to the choice of Tillage, and Merchandi<U+017F>e, for the Subject of that which is the mo<U+017F>t Celebrated of them. He is every where bent on In<U+017F>truction, avoids all manner of Digre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and does not <U+017F>tir out of the Field once in the whole <hi>Georgic.</hi> His Method in de<U+017F>cribing Month after Month with its proper Sea<U+017F>ons and Employments, is too grave and fim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it takes off from the <U+017F>urprize and variety of the Poem, and makes the whole look but like a modern Almanack in Ver<U+017F>e. The Reader is carried through a cour<U+017F>e of Weather, and may beforehand gue<U+017F>s whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is to meet with Snow or Rain, Clouds or Sun<U+017F>hine in the next De<U+017F>cription. His De<U+017F>criptions indeed have abundance of Nature in them, but then it is Nature in her <U+017F>implicity and undre<U+017F>s. Thus when he <U+017F>peaks of <hi>January;</hi> the Wild-Bea<U+017F>ts, <U+017F>ays he, run <U+017F>hivering through the Woods with their Heads <U+017F>tooping to the ground, and their Tails clapt between their Legs; the Goats and Oxen are almo<U+017F>t flead with Cold; but it is not <U+017F>o bad with the Sheep, becau<U+017F>e they have a thick Coat of Wooll about 'em. The Old Men too are bitterly pincht with the Weather, but the young Girls feel nothing of it, who <U+017F>it at home
<pb facs="tcp:43031:67"/>
with their Mothers by a warm Fire-<U+017F>ide. Thus does the Old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man give him<U+017F>elf up to a loo<U+017F>e kind of Tattle, rather than endeavour after a ju<U+017F>t Poetical De<U+017F>cription. Nor has he <U+017F>hewn more of Art or Judgment in the Precepts he has given us, which are <U+017F>own <U+017F>o very thick, that they clog the Poem too much, and are often <U+017F>o minute and full of Circum<U+017F>tances, that they weaken and un-nerve his Ver<U+017F>e. But after all, we are beholding to him for the fir<U+017F>t rough <hi>sketch</hi> of a <hi>Georgic:</hi> where we may <U+017F>till di<U+017F>cover <U+017F>omething venerable in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickne<U+017F>s of the Work; but if we wou'd <U+017F>ee the De<U+017F>ign enlarg'd, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures reform'd, the Colouring laid on, and the whole Piece fini<U+017F>h'd, we mu<U+017F>t expect it from a greater Ma<U+017F>ter's hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> has drawn out the Rules for Tillage and Planting into Two Books, which <hi>He<U+017F>iod</hi> has di<U+017F>patcht in half a one; but has <U+017F>o rais'd the natural rudene<U+017F>s and <U+017F>implicity of his Subject with <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>ignificancy of Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, <U+017F>uch a Pomp of Ver<U+017F>e, <U+017F>uch variety of Tran<U+017F>itions, and <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>olemn Air in his Reflections, that if we look on both Poets toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we <U+017F>ee in one the plainne<U+017F>s of a down-right Country-Man, and in the other, <U+017F>omething of a Ru<U+017F>tick Maje<U+017F>ty, like that of a <hi>Roman</hi> Dictator at the Plow-Tail. He delivers the meane<U+017F>t of his Precepts with a kind of Grandeur, he breaks the Clods and to<U+017F><U+017F>es the Dung about with an air of gracefulne<U+017F>s. His Progno<U+017F>tications of the Weather are taken out of <hi>Aratus,</hi> where we may <U+017F>ee how judiciou<U+017F>ly he has pickt out tho<U+017F>e that are mo<U+017F>t proper for his Husbandman's Ob<U+017F>ervation; how he has enforc'd the Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and heighten'd the Images which he found in the Original.</p>
                  <p>The Second Book has more wit in it, and a greater boldne<U+017F>s in its Metaphors than any of the re<U+017F>t. The Poet with a great Beauty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies Oblivion, Ignorance, Wonder, De<U+017F>ire and the like to his Trees. The la<U+017F>t <hi>Georgic</hi> has indeed as many Metaphors, but not <U+017F>o daring as this; for Humane Thoughts and Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions may be more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a<U+017F>crib'd to a Bee, than to an Inanimate Plant. He who reads over the Plea<U+017F>ures of a Country Life, as they are de<U+017F>crib'd by <hi>Virgil</hi> in the latter end of this Book, can <U+017F>carce be of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Mind, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring even the Life of a Philo<U+017F>opher to it.</p>
                  <p>We may I think read the Poet's Clime in his De<U+017F>cription, for he <U+017F>eems to have been in a <U+017F>weat at the Writing of it.
<q>
                        <l>—O Quis me gelidis <U+017F>ub Montibus Haemi</l>
                        <l>Si<U+017F>tat, &amp; ingenti ramorum protegat umbr â!</l>
                     </q>
And is every where mentioning among his chief Plea<U+017F>ures, the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of his Shades and Rivers, Vales and Grottos, which a more Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Poet wou'd have omitted for the de<U+017F>cription of a Sunny Hill, and Fire-<U+017F>ide.</p>
                  <p>The Third <hi>Georgic</hi> <U+017F>eems to be the mo<U+017F>t labour'd of 'em all; there is a wonderful Vigour and Spirit in the de<U+017F>cription of the Hor<U+017F>e and Chariot-Race. The force of Love is repre<U+017F>ented in Noble In<U+017F>tances, and very Sublime Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions. The <hi>Scythian</hi> Winter-piece appears <U+017F>o very cold and bleak to the Eye, that a Man can <U+017F>carce look on it without <U+017F>hivering. The Murrain at the end has all the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ivene<U+017F>s
<pb facs="tcp:43031:67"/>
that words can give. It was here that the Poet <U+017F>train'd hard to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do <hi>Lucretius</hi> in the de<U+017F>cription of his Plague; and if the Reader wou'd <U+017F>ee what <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s he had, he may find it at large in <hi>Scaliger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Virgil</hi> <U+017F>eems no where <U+017F>o well pleas'd, as when he is got among his Bees in the Fourth <hi>Georgic:</hi> And Ennobles the Actions of <U+017F>o trivial a Creature, with Metaphors drawn from the mo<U+017F>t important Concerns of Mankind. His Ver<U+017F>es are not in a greater noi<U+017F>e and hurry in the Battels of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Turnus,</hi> than in the Engagement of two Swarms. And as in his <hi>Aeneis</hi> he compares the Labours of his <hi>Trojans</hi> to tho<U+017F>e of Bees and Pi<U+017F>mires, here he compares the Labours of the Bees to tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Cyclops.</hi> In <U+017F>hort, the la<U+017F>t <hi>Georgic</hi> was a good Prelude to the <hi>Aeneis;</hi> and very well <U+017F>hew'd what the Poet could do in the de<U+017F>crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what was really great, by his de<U+017F>cribing the Mock-grandeur of an In<U+017F>ect with <U+017F>o good a grace. There is more plea<U+017F>antne<U+017F>s in the little Platform of a Garden, which he gives us about the middle of this Book, than in all the <U+017F>pacious Walks and Water-works of <hi>Rapin</hi>'s. The Speech of <hi>Proteus</hi> at the end can never be enough admir'd, and was indeed very fit to conclude <U+017F>o Divine a Work.</p>
                  <p>After this particular account of the Beauties in the <hi>Georgics,</hi> I <U+017F>hou'd in the next place endeavour to point out its imperfections, if it has any. But tho' I think there are <U+017F>ome few parts in it that are not <U+017F>o Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as the re<U+017F>t, I <U+017F>hall not pre<U+017F>ume to name them, as rather <U+017F>u<U+017F>pecting my own Judgment, than I can believe a fault to be in that Poem, which lay <U+017F>o long under <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Correction, and had his la<U+017F>t hand put to it. The fir<U+017F>t <hi>Georgic</hi> was probably Burle<U+017F>qu'd in the Author's Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; for we <U+017F>till find in the Scholia<U+017F>ts a Ver<U+017F>e that ridicules part of a Line Tran<U+017F>lated from <hi>He<U+017F>iod. Nudus Ara, <U+017F>ere Nudus—</hi>And we may ea<U+017F>ily gue<U+017F>s at the Judgment of this extraordinary Critick, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was, from his Cen<U+017F>uring this particular Precept. We may be <U+017F>ure <hi>Virgil</hi> wou'd not have Tran<U+017F>lated it from <hi>He<U+017F>iod,</hi> had he not di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd <U+017F>ome Beauty in it; and indeed the Beauty of it is what I have before ob<U+017F>erv'd to be frequently met with in <hi>Virgil,</hi> the delivering the Precept <U+017F>o indirectly, and <U+017F>ingling out the particular circum<U+017F>tance of Sowing and Plowing naked, to <U+017F>ugge<U+017F>t to us that the<U+017F>e Employments are proper only in the hot Sea<U+017F>on of the Year.</p>
                  <p>I <U+017F>hall not here compare the Stile of the <hi>Georgics</hi> with that of <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> which the Reader may <U+017F>ee already done in the Preface to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Volume of <hi>Mi<U+017F>cellany Poems;</hi> but <U+017F>hall conclude this Poem to be the mo<U+017F>t Compleat, Elaborate, and fini<U+017F>ht Piece of all Antiquity. The <hi>Aeneis</hi> indeed is of a Nobler kind, but the <hi>Georgic</hi> is more perfect in its kind. The <hi>Aeneid</hi> has a greater variety of Beauties in it, but tho<U+017F>e of the <hi>Georgic</hi> are more exqui<U+017F>ite. In <U+017F>hort, the <hi>Georgic</hi> has all the perfection that can be expected in a Poem written by the greate<U+017F>t Poet in the Flower of his Age, when his Invention was ready, his Imagination warm, his Judgment <U+017F>ettled, and all his Faculties in their full Vigour and Maturity.</p>

                  <p>A HEROICK Poem, truly <U+017F>uch, is undoubtedly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t Work which the Soul of Man is capable to perform. The De<U+017F>ign of it, is to form the Mind to Heroick Virtue by Example; 'tis convey'd in Ver<U+017F>e, that it may delight, while it in<U+017F>tructs: The Action of it is always one, entire, and great. The lea<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t trivial Epi<U+017F>odes, or under-Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are interwoven in it, are parts either nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to carry on the main De<U+017F>ign. Either <U+017F>o nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, that without them the Poem mu<U+017F>t be Imperfect, or <U+017F>o convenient, that no others can be imagin'd more <U+017F>uitable to the place in which they are. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be left void in a firm Building; even the Cavities ought not to be fill'd with Rubbi<U+017F>h, which is of a peri<U+017F>hable kind, de<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the <U+017F>trength: But with Brick or Stone, though of le<U+017F>s pieces, yet of the <U+017F>ame Nature, and fitted to the Cranies. Even the lea<U+017F>t por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them mu<U+017F>t be of the Epick kind; all things mu<U+017F>t be Grave, Maje<U+017F>tical, and Sublime: Nothing of a Foreign Nature, like the trifling <hi>Novels,</hi> which <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> and others have in<U+017F>erted in their Poems. By which the Reader is mi<U+017F>s-led into another <U+017F>ort of Plea<U+017F>ure, oppo<U+017F>ite to that which is de<U+017F>ign'd in an Epick Poem. One rai<U+017F>es the Soul and hardens it to Virtue, the other <U+017F>oftens it again and unbends it into Vice. One conduces to the Poet's aim, the compleating of his Work; which he is driving on, labouring and ha<U+017F>t'ning in every Line: the other <U+017F>lackens his pace, diverts him from his Way, and locks him up like a Knight Errant in an Enchanted Ca<U+017F>tle, when he <U+017F>hould be pur<U+017F>uing his fir<U+017F>t Adventure. <hi>Statius,</hi> as <hi>Bo<U+017F><U+017F>u</hi> has well ob<U+017F>erv'd, was ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of trying his <U+017F>trength with his Ma<U+017F>ter <hi>Virgil,</hi> as <hi>Virgil</hi> had before try'd his with <hi>Homer.</hi> The <hi>Grecian</hi> gave the two <hi>Romans</hi> an Example, in the Games which were Celebrated at the Funerals of <hi>Patroclus. Virgil</hi> imitated the Invention of <hi>Homer,</hi> but chang'd the Sports. But both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Poet, took their occa<U+017F>ions from the Subject; though to confe<U+017F>s the Truth, they were both Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, or at be<U+017F>t, convenient parts of it, rather than of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing
<pb facs="tcp:43031:138"/>
from it. <hi>Statius,</hi> who through his whole Poem, is noted for want of Conduct and Judgment; in<U+017F>tead of <U+017F>taying, as he might have done, for the Death of <hi>Capaneus, Hippomedon, Tideus,</hi> or <U+017F>ome other of his Seven Champions, (who are Heroes all alike) or more properly for the Tragical end of the two Brothers, who<U+017F>e Exequies the next Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>or had lei<U+017F>ure to perform, when the Siege was rais'd, and in the Interval betwixt the Poets fir<U+017F>t Action, and his <U+017F>econd; went out of his way, as it were on propen<U+017F>e Malice to commit a Fault. For he took his opportunity to kill a Royal Infant, by the means of a Serpent, (that Author of all Evil) to make way for tho<U+017F>e Funeral Honours, which he intended for him. Now if this Innocent had been of any Relation to his <hi>Thebais;</hi> if he had either farther'd or hinder'd the taking of the Town, the Poet might have found <U+017F>ome <U+017F>orry Excu<U+017F>e at lea<U+017F>t, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Reader from the promis'd Siege. I can think of nothing to plead for him, but what I verily believe he thought him<U+017F>elf; which was, that as the Funerals of <hi>Anchi<U+017F>es</hi> were <U+017F>olemniz'd in <hi>Sicily,</hi> <U+017F>o tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Archemorus</hi> <U+017F>hould be celebrated in <hi>Candy.</hi> For the la<U+017F>t was an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>land; and a better than the fir<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Jove</hi> was Born there. On the<U+017F>e terms, this <hi>Capaneus</hi> of a Poet ingag'd his two Immortal Predece<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ours, and his Succe<U+017F>s was an<U+017F>werable to his Enterpri<U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>If this Oeconomy mu<U+017F>t be ob<U+017F>erv'd in the minute<U+017F>t Parts of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick Poem, which, to a common Reader, <U+017F>eem to be detach'd from the Body, and almo<U+017F>t independent of it; what Soul, tho' <U+017F>ent into the World with great advantages of Nature, cultivated with the liberal Arts and Sciences; conver<U+017F>ant with Hi<U+017F>tories of the Dead, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd with Ob<U+017F>ervations on the Living, can be <U+017F>ufficient to inform the whole Body of <U+017F>o great a Work? I touch here but tran<U+017F>iently, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <U+017F>trict Method, on <U+017F>ome few of tho<U+017F>e many Rules of imitating Nature, which <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> drew from <hi>Homer</hi>'s Iliads and Ody<U+017F><U+017F>es, and which he fitted to the <hi>Drama;</hi> furni<U+017F>hing him<U+017F>elf al<U+017F>o with Ob<U+017F>erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Practice of the Theater, when it flouri<U+017F>h'd under <hi>Ae<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilus, Eurypides,</hi> and <hi>Sophocles.</hi> For the Original of the Stage was from the Epick Poem. Narration, doubtle<U+017F>s, preceded Acting, and gave Laws to it: What at fir<U+017F>t was told Artfully, was, in proce<U+017F>s of time, repre<U+017F>ented gracefully to the <U+017F>ight, and hearing. Tho<U+017F>e Epi<U+017F>odes of <hi>Homer,</hi> which were proper for the Stage, the Poets amplify'd each into an Action: Out of his Limbs they form'd their Bodies: What he had Contracted they Enlarg'd: Out of one <hi>Hercules</hi> were made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite of Pigmies; yet all endued with humane Souls: For from him, their great Creator, they have each of them the <hi>Divinae particulam Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae.</hi> They flow'd from him at fir<U+017F>t, and are at la<U+017F>t re<U+017F>olv'd into him. Nor were they only animated by him, but their Mea<U+017F>ure and Symetry was owing to him. His one, entire, and great Action was Copied by them according to the proportions of the <hi>Drama:</hi> If he fini<U+017F>h'd his Orb within the Year, it <U+017F>uffic'd to teach them, that their Action being le<U+017F>s, and being al<U+017F>o le<U+017F>s diver<U+017F>ify'd with Incidents, their Orb, of con<U+017F>equence, mu<U+017F>t be circum<U+017F>crib'd in a le<U+017F>s compa<U+017F>s, which they reduc'd, within the limits either of a Natural or an Artificial Day. So that as he taught them to amplifie what he had <U+017F>horten'd, by the <U+017F>ame Rule apply'd the contrary way, he taught them to <U+017F>horten what he had amplifi'd. Tragedy is the minature of Humane Life; an Epick Poem is the draught at length. Here, my Lord, I mu<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract al<U+017F>o, for, before I was aware, I was almo<U+017F>t running into a long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, to prove that there is no <U+017F>uch ab<U+017F>olute nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity that the

time of a Stage-Action <U+017F>hou'd <U+017F>o <U+017F>trictly be confin'd to Twenty Four Hours, as never to exceed them, for which <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> contends, and the <hi>Grecian</hi> Stage has practis'd. Some longer <U+017F>pace, on <U+017F>ome occa<U+017F>ions, I think may be allow'd, e<U+017F>pecially for the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Theater, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more variety of Incidents than the <hi>French. Corneille</hi> him<U+017F>elf, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long Practice, was inclin'd to think, that the time allotted by the Ancients was too <U+017F>hort to rai<U+017F>e and fini<U+017F>h a great Action: And better a Mechanick Rule were <U+017F>tretch'd or broken, than a great Beauty were omitted. To rai<U+017F>e, and afterwards to calm the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, to purge the Soul from Pride, by the Examples of Humane Mi<U+017F>eries, which befall the greate<U+017F>t; in few words, to expel Arrogance, and introduce Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, are the great effects of Tragedy. Great, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, if they were altogether as true as they are pompous. But are Habits to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd at three Hours warning? Are radical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es <U+017F>o <U+017F>uddenly remov'd? A Mountebank may promi<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a Cure, but a skilful Phy<U+017F>ician will not undertake it. An Epick Poem is not in <U+017F>o much ha<U+017F>te; it works lei<U+017F>urely; the Changes which it makes are <U+017F>low; but the Cure is likely to be more perfect. The effects of Tragedy, as I <U+017F>aid, are too violent to be la<U+017F>ting. If it be an<U+017F>wer'd that for this Rea<U+017F>on Tragedies are often to be <U+017F>een, and the Do<U+017F>e to be repeated; this is tacitely to confe<U+017F>s, that there is more Virtue in one Heroick Poem than in many Tragedies. A Man is humbled one Day, and his Pride returns the next. Chymical Medicines are ob<U+017F>erv'd to Relieve oft'ner than to Cure: For 'tis the nature of Spirits to make <U+017F>wift impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, but not deep. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenical</hi> Decoctions, to which I may properly compare an Epick Poem, have more of Body in them; they work by their <U+017F>ub<U+017F>tance and their weight. It is one Rea<U+017F>on of <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi>'s to prove, that Tragedy is the more Noble, becau<U+017F>e it turns in a <U+017F>horter Compa<U+017F>s; the whole Action being circum<U+017F>crib'd within the <U+017F>pace of Four-and-Twenty Hours. He might prove as well that a Mu<U+017F>hroom is to be preferr'd before a Peach, becau<U+017F>e it <U+017F>hoots up in the compa<U+017F>s of a Night. A Chariot may be driven round the Pillar in le<U+017F>s <U+017F>pace than a large Machine, becau<U+017F>e the Bulk is not <U+017F>o great: Is the <hi>Moon</hi> a more Noble Planet than <hi>Saturn,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <U+017F>he makes her Revolution in le<U+017F>s than Thirty Days, and He in little le<U+017F>s than Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years? Both their Orbs are in proportion to their <U+017F>everal Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; and, con<U+017F>equently, the quickne<U+017F>s or <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s of their Motion, and the time of their circumvolutions, is no Argument of the greater or le<U+017F>s Perfection. And be<U+017F>ides, what Virtue is there in a Tragedy, which is not contain'd in an Epick Poem? Where Pride is humbled, Vertue rewarded, and Vice puni<U+017F>h'd; and tho<U+017F>e more amply treated, than the narrowne<U+017F>s of the <hi>Drama</hi> can admit? The <U+017F>hining Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiy of an Epick Heroe, his Magnanimity, his Con<U+017F>tancy, his Patience, his Piety, or whatever Characteri<U+017F>tical Virtue his Poet gives him, rai<U+017F>es fir<U+017F>t our Admiration: We are naturally prone to imitate what we admire: And frequent Acts produce a habit. If the Hero's chief quality be vicious, as for Example, the Choler and ob<U+017F>tinate de<U+017F>ire of Vengeance in <hi>Achilles,</hi> yet the Moral is In<U+017F>tructive: And be<U+017F>ides, we are inform'd in the very propo<U+017F>ition of the <hi>Iliads,</hi> that this anger was pernicious: That it brought a thou<U+017F>and ills on the <hi>Grecian</hi> Camp. The Courage of <hi>Achilles</hi> is propos'd to imitation, not his Pride and Di<U+017F>obedience to his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, nor his brutal Cruelty to his dead Enemy, nor the <U+017F>elling his Body to his Father. We abhor the<U+017F>e Actions while we read them, and what we abhor we never imitate: The Poet only <U+017F>hews them like Rocks or Quick-Sands, to be <U+017F>hun'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:139"/>
By this Example the Criticks have concluded that it is not nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary the Manners of the Heroe <U+017F>hould be virtuous. They are Poetically good if they are of a Piece. Though where a Character of perfect Virtue is <U+017F>et before us, 'tis more lovely: for there the whole Heroe is to be imitated. This is the <hi>Aeneas</hi> of our Author: this is that Idea of perfection in an Epick Poem, which Painters and Statuaries have only in their minds; and which no hands are able to expre<U+017F>s. The<U+017F>e are the Beauties of a God in a Humane Body. When the Picture of <hi>Achilles</hi> is drawn in Tragedy, he is taken with tho<U+017F>e Warts, and Moles, and hard Features, by tho<U+017F>e who repre<U+017F>ent him on the Stage, or he is no more <hi>Achilles:</hi> for his Creatour <hi>Homer</hi> has <U+017F>o de<U+017F>crib'd him. Yet even thus he appears a perfect Heroe, though an imperfect Character of Vertue. <hi>Horace</hi> Paints him after <hi>Homer,</hi> and delivers him to be Copied on the Stage with all tho<U+017F>e imperfections. Therefore they are either not faults in a Heroick Poem, or faults common to the <hi>Drama.</hi> After all, on the whole merits of the Cau<U+017F>e, it mu<U+017F>t be acknowledg'd that the Epick Poem is more for the Manners, and Tragedy for the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions. The Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as I have <U+017F>aid, are violent: and acute Di<U+017F>tempers require Medicines of a <U+017F>trong and <U+017F>peedy operation. Ill habits of the Mind are like Chronical Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>es, to be corrected by degrees, and Cur'd by Alteratives: wherein though Purges are <U+017F>ometimes nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary, yet Diet, good Air, and moderate Exerci<U+017F>e, have the greate<U+017F>t part. The Matter being thus <U+017F>tated, it will appear that both <U+017F>orts of Poetry are of u<U+017F>e for their proper ends. The Stage is more active, the Epick Poem works at greater lei<U+017F>ure, yet is active too, when need requires. For Dialogue is imitated by the <hi>Drama,</hi> from the more active parts of it. One puts off a Fit like the <hi>Quinquina,</hi> and relieves us only for a time; the other roots out the Di<U+017F>temper, and gives a healthful habit. The Sun en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens and chears us, di<U+017F>pels Fogs, and warms the ground with his daily Beams; but the Corn is <U+017F>ow'd, increa<U+017F>es, is ripen'd, and is reap'd for u<U+017F>e in proce<U+017F>s of time, and in its proper Sea<U+017F>on. I proceed from the greatne<U+017F>s of the Action, to the Dignity of the Actours, I mean to the Per<U+017F>ons employ'd in both Poems. There likewi<U+017F>e Tragedy will be <U+017F>een to borrow from the <hi>Epopee;</hi> and that which borrows is always of le<U+017F>s Dignity, becau<U+017F>e it has not of its own. A Subject, 'tis true, may lend to his Soveraign, but the act of borrowing makes the King inferiour, becau<U+017F>e he wants, and the Subject <U+017F>upplies. And <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the Per<U+017F>ons of the <hi>Drama</hi> wholly Fabulous, or of the Poet's Invention, yet Heroick Poetry gave him the Examples of that Invention, becau<U+017F>e it was fir<U+017F>t, and <hi>Homer</hi> the common Father of the Stage. I know not of any one advantage, which Tragedy can boa<U+017F>t above Heroick Poetry, but that it is repre<U+017F>ented to the view, as well as read: and in<U+017F>tructs in the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>et, as well as on the Theatre. This is an uncontended Excellence, and a chief Branch of its Prerogative; yet I may be allow'd to <U+017F>ay without partiality, that herein the Actors <U+017F>hare the Poet's prai<U+017F>e. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip knows <U+017F>ome Modern Tragedies which are beautiful on the Stage, and yet I am confident you wou'd not read them. <hi>Tryphon</hi> the Stationer complains they are <U+017F>eldom ask'd for in his Shop. The Poet who Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>h'd in the Scene, is damn'd in the <hi>Ruelle;</hi> nay more, he is not e<U+017F>teem'd a good Poet by tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>ee and hear his Extravagancies with delight. They are a <U+017F>ort of <U+017F>tately Fu<U+017F>tian, and lofty Childi<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Nature can give a <U+017F>incere plea<U+017F>ure; where that is not imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 'tis Grote<U+017F>que Painting, the fine Woman ends in a Fi<U+017F>hes Tail.</p>
                  <p>I might al<U+017F>o add, that many things, which not only plea<U+017F>e, but are
<pb facs="tcp:43031:139"/>
real Beauties in the reading, wou'd appear ab<U+017F>urd upon the Stage: and tho<U+017F>e not only the <hi>Specio<U+017F>a Miracula,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> calls them; of Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, of <hi>Scylla, Antiphates,</hi> and the <hi>Le<U+017F>trigons,</hi> which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<U+017F>ented even in Opera's; but the prowe<U+017F>s of <hi>Achilles</hi> or <hi>Aeneas</hi> wou'd appear ridiculous in our Dwarf-Heroes of the Theatre. We can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they routed Armies in <hi>Homer</hi> or in <hi>Virgil,</hi> but <hi>ne Hercules contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duos</hi> in the <hi>Drama.</hi> I forbear to in<U+017F>tance in many things which the Stage cannot or ought not to repre<U+017F>ent. For I have <U+017F>aid already more than I intended on this Subject, and <U+017F>hou'd fear it might be turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t me; that I plead for the pre-eminence of Epick Poetry, becau<U+017F>e I have taken <U+017F>ome pains in tran<U+017F>lating <hi>Virgil;</hi> if this were the fir<U+017F>t time that I had deliver'd my Opinion in this Di<U+017F>pute. But I have more than once already maintain'd the Rights of my two Ma<U+017F>ters again<U+017F>t their Rivals of the Scene, even while I wrote Tragedies my <U+017F>elf, and had no thoughts of this pre<U+017F>ent Undertaking. I <U+017F>ubmit my Opinion to your Judgment, who are better qualified than any Man I know to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this Controver<U+017F>ie. You come, my Lord, in<U+017F>tructed in the Cau<U+017F>e, and needed not that I <U+017F>hou'd open it. Your E<U+017F><U+017F>ay of Poetry, which was publi<U+017F>h'd without a Name, and of which I was not honour'd with the Confidence, I read over and over with much delight, and as much in<U+017F>truction: and, without flattering you, or making my <U+017F>elf more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral than I am, not without <U+017F>ome Envy. I was loath to be inform'd how an Epick Poem <U+017F>hou'd be written, or how a Tragedy <U+017F>hou'd be contriv'd and manag'd in better Ver<U+017F>e and with more judgment than I cou'd teach others. A Native of <hi>Parna<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> and bred up in the Studies of its Fundamental Laws, may receive new Lights from his Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, but 'tis a grudging kind of prai<U+017F>e which he gives his Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. He is more oblig'd than he is willing to acknowledge: there is a tincture of Malice in his Commendations. For where I own I am taught, I confe<U+017F>s my want of Knowledge. A Judge upon the Bench, may, out of good Nature, or at lea<U+017F>t intere<U+017F>t, encourage the Pleadings of a puny Councellor, but he does not willingly commend his Brother Serjeant at the Bar, e<U+017F>pecially when he controuls his Law, and expo<U+017F>es that ignorance which is made Sacred by his Place. I gave the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Author his due Commendation, I mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>e<U+017F>s, but who can an<U+017F>wer for me, and for the re<U+017F>t of the Poets, who heard me read the Poem, whether we <U+017F>hou'd not have been better pleas'd to have <U+017F>een our own Names at the bottom of the Title Page? perhaps we commended it the more, that we might <U+017F>eem to be above the Cen<U+017F>ure. We are naturally di<U+017F>pleas'd with an unknown Critick, as the Ladies are with a Lampooner, becau<U+017F>e we are bitten in the dark, and know not where to fa<U+017F>ten our Revenge. But great Excellencies will work their way through all <U+017F>orts of oppo<U+017F>ition. I applauded rather out of decency than Affection; and was Ambitious, as <U+017F>ome yet can witne<U+017F>s, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a Man, with whom I had the honour to Conver<U+017F>e, and that almo<U+017F>t daily, for <U+017F>o many years together. Heaven knows if I have heartily forgiven you this deceit. You extorted a Prai<U+017F>e which I <U+017F>hou'd willingly have given had I known you. Nothing had been more ea<U+017F>ie than to commend a Patron of a long <U+017F>tanding. The World wou'd joyn with me, if the Encomiums were ju<U+017F>t; and if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju<U+017F>t, wou'd excu<U+017F>e a grateful Flatterer. But to come <hi>Anonymous</hi> upon me, and force me to commend you again<U+017F>t my intere<U+017F>t, was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <U+017F>o fair, give me leave to <U+017F>ay, as it was Politick. For by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing your Quality, you might clearly under<U+017F>tand how your Work
<pb facs="tcp:43031:140"/>
<U+017F>ucceeded; and that the general approbation was given to your Merit not your Titles. Thus like <hi>Apelles</hi> you <U+017F>tood un<U+017F>een behind your own <hi>Venus,</hi> and receiv'd the prai<U+017F>es of the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ing Multitude: the Work was commended, not the Author: And I doubt not this was one of the mo<U+017F>t plea<U+017F>ing Adventures of your Life.</p>
                  <p>I have detain'd your Lord<U+017F>hip longer than I intended in this Di<U+017F>pute of preference betwixt the Epick Poem, and the <hi>Dramae:</hi> and yet have not formally an<U+017F>wer'd any of the Arguments which are brought by <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide, and <U+017F>et in the faire<U+017F>t light by <hi>Dacier.</hi> But I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, without looking on the Book, I may have touch'd on <U+017F>ome of the Objections. For in this Addre<U+017F>s to your Lord<U+017F>hip, I de<U+017F>ign not a Treati<U+017F>e of Heroick Poetry, but write in a loo<U+017F>e Epi<U+017F>tolary way, <U+017F>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what tending to that Subject, after the Example of <hi>Horace,</hi> in his Fir<U+017F>t Epi<U+017F>tle of the Second Book to <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> and of that to the <hi>Pi<U+017F>o</hi>'s, which we call his <hi>Art of Poetry.</hi> In both of which he ob<U+017F>erves no Method that I can trace, whatever <hi>Scaliger</hi> the Father, or <hi>Hein<U+017F>ius</hi> may have <U+017F>een, or rather think they had <U+017F>een. I have taken up, laid down, and re<U+017F>um'd as often as I pleas'd the <U+017F>ame Subject: and this loo<U+017F>e pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding I <U+017F>hall u<U+017F>e thro' all this Prefatory Dedication. Yet all this while I have been Sailing with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ide-wind or other toward the Point I propos'd in the beginning; the Greatne<U+017F>s and Excellency of an Heroick Poem, with <U+017F>ome of the difficulties which attend that work. The Compari<U+017F>on therefore which I made betwixt the <hi>Epopee</hi> and the Tragedy was not altogether a digre<U+017F><U+017F>ion; for 'tis concluded on all hands, that they are both the Ma<U+017F>ter-pieces of Humane Wit.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I may be bold to draw this Corollary from what has been already <U+017F>aid, That the File of Heroick Poets is very <U+017F>hort: all are not <U+017F>uch who have a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd that lofty Title in Ancient or Modern Ages, or have been <U+017F>o e<U+017F>teem'd by their partial and ignorant Admirers.</p>
                  <p>There have been but one great <hi>Ilias</hi> and one <hi>Aeneis</hi> in <U+017F>o many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The next, but the next with a long interval betwixt, was the <hi>Jeru<U+017F>alem:</hi> I mean not <U+017F>o much in di<U+017F>tance of time, as in Excellency. After the<U+017F>e three are entred, <U+017F>ome Lord Chamberlain <U+017F>hould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <U+017F>ome Critick of Authority <U+017F>hou'd be <U+017F>et before the door, to keep out a Crowd of little Poets, who pre<U+017F>s for Admi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and are not of Quality. <hi>Maevius</hi> wou'd be deafning your Lord<U+017F>hip's Ears with his
<q>Fortunam Priami, Cantabo, &amp; Nobile Bellum.</q>
meer Fu<U+017F>tian, as <hi>Horace</hi> would tell you from behind, without pre<U+017F><U+017F>ing forward, and more <U+017F>moak than fire. <hi>Pulci, Boyardo,</hi> and <hi>Ario<U+017F>to,</hi> wou'd cry out, make room for the <hi>Italian</hi> Poets, the de<U+017F>cendants of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> in a right Line. Father <hi>Le Moin</hi> with his Saint <hi>Louis;</hi> and <hi>Scudery</hi> with his <hi>Alaric,</hi> for a godly King, and a <hi>Gothick</hi> Conquerour; and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelain</hi> wou'd take it ill that his Maid <U+017F>hou'd be refus'd a place with <hi>Helen</hi> and <hi>Lavinia. Spencer</hi> has a better plea for his <hi>Fairy-Queen,</hi> had his action been fini<U+017F>h'd, or had been one. And <hi>Milton,</hi> if the Devil had not been his Heroe in<U+017F>tead of <hi>Adam,</hi> if the Gyant had not foil'd the Knight, and driven him out of his <U+017F>trong hold, to wander through the World with his Lady Errant: and if there had not been more Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Per<U+017F>ons than Humane, in his Poem. After the<U+017F>e, the re<U+017F>t of our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli<U+017F>h</hi> Poets <U+017F>hall not be mention'd. I have that Honour for them which I ought to have: but if they are Worthies, they are not to be rank'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t
<pb facs="tcp:43031:140"/>
the three whom I have nam'd, and who are e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h'd in their Reputation.</p>
                  <p>Before I quitted the Compari<U+017F>on betwixt Epick Poetry and Tragedy, I <U+017F>hou'd have acquainted my Judge with one advantage of the former over the latter, which I now ca<U+017F>ually remember out of the Preface of <hi>Segrais</hi> before his Tran<U+017F>lation of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> or out of <hi>Bo<U+017F><U+017F>u,</hi> no matter which. The <U+017F>tile of the Heroick Poem is and ought to be more lofty than that of the <hi>Drama.</hi> The Critick is certainly in the right, for the Rea<U+017F>on already urg'd: The work of Tragedy is on the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and in Dialogue, both of them abhor <U+017F>trong Metaphors, in which the <hi>Epopee</hi> delights. A Poet cannot <U+017F>peak too plainly on the Stage: for <hi>Volat irrevocabile verbum;</hi> the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e is lo<U+017F>t if it be not taken flying: but what we read alone we have lei<U+017F>ure to dige<U+017F>t. There an Author may beautifie his Sen<U+017F>e by the boldne<U+017F>s of his Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, which if we under<U+017F>tand not fully at the fir<U+017F>t, we may dwell upon it, 'till we find the <U+017F>ecret force and excellence. That which cures the Manners by alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Phy<U+017F>ick, as I <U+017F>aid before, mu<U+017F>t proceed by in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible degrees; but that which purges the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, mu<U+017F>t do its bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s all at once, or wholly fail of its effect, at lea<U+017F>t in the pre<U+017F>ent Operation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repeated Do<U+017F>es. We mu<U+017F>t beat the Iron while 'tis hot, but we may poli<U+017F>h it at lei<U+017F>ure. Thus, my Lord, you pay the Fine of my forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne<U+017F>s, and yet the merits of both Cau<U+017F>es are where they were, and undecided, 'till you declare whether it be more for the benefit of Mankind to have their Manners in general corrected, or their Pride and hard-heartedne<U+017F>s remov'd.</p>
                  <p>I mu<U+017F>t now come clo<U+017F>er to my pre<U+017F>ent bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s: and not think of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more inva<U+017F>ive Wars abroad, when like <hi>Hannibal,</hi> I am call'd back to the defence of my own Country. <hi>Virgil</hi> is attack'd by many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: He has a whole Confederacy again<U+017F>t him, and I mu<U+017F>t endeavour to defend him as well as I am able. But their principal Objections being again<U+017F>t his Moral, the duration or length of time taken up in the action of the Poem, and what they have to urge again<U+017F>t the Manners of his Hero, I <U+017F>hall omit the re<U+017F>t as meer Cavils of Grammarians: at the wor<U+017F>t but ca<U+017F>ual <U+017F>lips of a Great Man's Pen, or incon<U+017F>iderable faults of an admirable Poem, which the Author had not lei<U+017F>ure to review be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death. <hi>Macrobius</hi> has an<U+017F>wer'd what the Ancients cou'd urge again<U+017F>t him: and <U+017F>ome things I have lately read in <hi>Tanneguy le Fevrè, Valois,</hi> and another whom I name not, which are <U+017F>carce worth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wering. They begin with the Moral of his Poem, which I have el<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where confe<U+017F>s'd, and <U+017F>till mu<U+017F>t own not to be <U+017F>o Noble as that of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> But let both be fairly <U+017F>tated, and without contradicting my fir<U+017F>t Opinion, I can <U+017F>hew that <hi>Virgil</hi>'s was as u<U+017F>eful to the <hi>Romans</hi> of his Age, as <hi>Homer</hi>'s was to the <hi>Grecians</hi> of his; in what time <U+017F>oever he may be <U+017F>uppos'd to have liv'd and flouri<U+017F>h'd. <hi>Homer</hi>'s Moral was to urge the nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity of Union, and of a good under<U+017F>tanding betwixt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate States and Princes engag'd in a War with a Mighty Monarch: as al<U+017F>o of Di<U+017F>cipline in an Army, and obedience in the <U+017F>everal Chiefs, to the Supream Commander of the joynt Forces. To inculcate this, he <U+017F>ets forth the ruinous Effects of Di<U+017F>cord in the Camp of tho<U+017F>e Allies, occa<U+017F>ion'd by the quarrel betwixt the General, and one of the next in Office under him. <hi>Agamemnon</hi> gives the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and <hi>Achilles</hi> re<U+017F>ents the injury. Both Parties are faulty in the Quarrel, and accordingly they are both puni<U+017F>h'd: the Agre<U+017F><U+017F>or is forc'd to <U+017F>ue for peace to his Inferiour, on di<U+017F>honourable Conditions; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erter
<pb facs="tcp:43031:141"/>
re<U+017F>u<U+017F>es the <U+017F>atisfaction offer'd, and his Ob<U+017F>tinacy co<U+017F>ts him his be<U+017F>t Friend. This works the Natural Effect of Choler, and turns his Rage again<U+017F>t him, by whom he was la<U+017F>t Affronted, and mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>ib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The greater Anger expels the le<U+017F>s; but his Caracter is <U+017F>till pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd. In the mean time the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army receives Lo<U+017F>s on Lo<U+017F>s, and is half de<U+017F>troy'd by a Pe<U+017F>tilence into the Bargain.</p>
                  <q>Quicquid delirant Reges plectuntur Achivi.</q>
                  <p>As the Poet, in the fir<U+017F>t part of the Example, had <U+017F>hewn the bad effects of Di<U+017F>cord, <U+017F>o after the Reconcilement, he gives the good effects of Unity. For <hi>Hector</hi> is <U+017F>lain, and then <hi>Troy</hi> mu<U+017F>t fall. By this, 'tis probable, that <hi>Homer</hi> liv'd when the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Monarchy was grown formidable to the <hi>Grecians:</hi> and that the joint Endeavours of his Country-men, were little enough to pre<U+017F>erve their common Freedom, from an encroaching Enemy. Such was his Moral, which all Criticks have allow'd to be more Noble than that of <hi>Virgil:</hi> though not adapted to the times in which the <hi>Roman</hi> Poet liv'd. Had <hi>Virgil</hi> flouri<U+017F>h'd in the Age of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and addre<U+017F>s'd to <hi>Scipio,</hi> he had probably taken the <U+017F>ame Moral, or <U+017F>ome other not unlike it. For then the <hi>Romans</hi> were in as much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Commonwealth, as the <hi>Grecians</hi> were from the <hi>Per<U+017F>ian</hi> Monarchy. But we are to con<U+017F>ider him as writing his Poem in a time when the Old Form of Government was <U+017F>ubverted, and a new one ju<U+017F>t E<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hed by <hi>Octavius Cae<U+017F>ar:</hi> In effect by force of Arms, but <U+017F>eemingly by the Con<U+017F>ent of the <hi>Roman</hi> People. The Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth had receiv'd a deadly Wound in the former Civil Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla.</hi> The Commons, while the fir<U+017F>t prevail'd, had almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>haken off the Yoke of the Nobility; and <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Cinna,</hi> like the Captains of the Mobb, under the <U+017F>pecious Pretence of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, and of doing Ju<U+017F>tice on the Oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ours of their Liberty, reveng'd them<U+017F>elves, without Form of Law, on their private Enemies. <hi>Sylla,</hi> in his turn, pro<U+017F>crib'd the Heads of the adver<U+017F>e Party: He too had nothing but Liberty and Reformation in his Mouth; (for the Cau<U+017F>e of Religion is but a Modern Motive to Rebellion, invented by the Chri<U+017F>tian Prie<U+017F>thood, refining on the Heathen:) <hi>Sylla,</hi> to be <U+017F>ure, meant no more good to the <hi>Roman</hi> People than <hi>Marius</hi> before him, whatever he declar'd; but Sacrific'd the Lives, and took the E<U+017F>tates of all his Enemies, to gratifie tho<U+017F>e who brought him into Power: Such was the Reformation of the Government by both Parties. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and the Commons were the two Ba<U+017F>es on which it <U+017F>tood; and the two Champions of either Faction, each de<U+017F>troy'd the Foundations of the other <U+017F>ide: So the Fabrique of con<U+017F>equence mu<U+017F>t fall betwxt them: And Tyranny mu<U+017F>t be built upon their Ruines. This comes of altering Fundamental Laws and Con<U+017F>titutions. Like him, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in good Health, lodg'd him<U+017F>elf in a Phy<U+017F>ician's Hou<U+017F>e, and was over-per<U+017F>waded by his Landlord to take Phy<U+017F>ick, of which he dyed, for the benefit of his Doctor. <hi>Stavo ben</hi> (was written on his Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>ma, per<U+017F>tar meglio, <U+017F>to qui.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Death of tho<U+017F>e two U<U+017F>urpers, the Commonwealth <U+017F>eem'd to recover, and held up its Head for a little time: But it was all the while in a deep Con<U+017F>umption, which is a flattering Di<U+017F>ea<U+017F>e. <hi>Pompey, Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> and <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> had found the Sweets of Arbitrary Power; and each being a check to the others growth, <U+017F>truck up a fal<U+017F>e Friend<U+017F>hip among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves; and divided the Government betwixt them,
<pb facs="tcp:43031:141"/>
which none of them was able to a<U+017F><U+017F>ume alone. The<U+017F>e were the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Spirited Men of their Age, that is, Patriots for their own Intere<U+017F>t. The Commonwealth look'd with a florid Countenance in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, <U+017F>pread in Bulk, and all the while was wa<U+017F>ting in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. Not to trouble your Lord<U+017F>hip with the Repetition of what you know: After the death of <hi>Cra<U+017F><U+017F>us, Pompey</hi> found him<U+017F>elf out-witted by <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar;</hi> broke with him, over-power'd him in the Senate, and caus'd many unju<U+017F>t Decrees to pa<U+017F>s again<U+017F>t him: <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> thus injur'd, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Faction of the Nobles, which was now uppermo<U+017F>t (for he was a <hi>Marian)</hi> had recour<U+017F>e to Arms; and his Cau<U+017F>e was ju<U+017F>t again<U+017F>t <hi>Pompey,</hi> but not again<U+017F>t his Country, who<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>titution ought to have been <U+017F>acred to him; and never to have been Violated on the account of any private Wrong. But he prevail'd, and Heav'n declaring for him, he became a Providential Monarch, under the Title of <hi>Perpetual Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> He being Murther'd by his own Son, whom I neither dare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, nor can ju<U+017F>tly blame (though <hi>Dante</hi> in his <hi>Inferno,</hi> has put him and <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ius,</hi> and <hi>Judas I<U+017F>cariot</hi> betwixt them, into the great Devil's Mouth) the Commonwealth popp'd up its Head for the third time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ius,</hi> and then <U+017F>unk for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Roman</hi> People were gro<U+017F>ly gull'd: twice or thrice over: and as often en<U+017F>lav'd in one Century, and under the <U+017F>ame pretence of Reformation. At la<U+017F>t the two Battles of <hi>Philippi,</hi> gave the deci<U+017F>ive <U+017F>troak again<U+017F>t Liberty; and not long after, the Commonwealth was turn'd into a Monarchy, by the Conduct and good Fortune of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus.</hi> 'Tis true, that the de<U+017F>potick Power could not have fallen into better Hands, than tho<U+017F>e of the fir<U+017F>t and <U+017F>econd <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar.</hi> Your Lord<U+017F>hip well knows what Obligations <hi>Virgil</hi> had to the latter of them: He <U+017F>aw, be<U+017F>ide, that the Commonwealth was lo<U+017F>t without re<U+017F><U+017F>ource: The Heads of it de<U+017F>troy'd; the Senate new moulded, grown degenerate; and either bought off, or thru<U+017F>ting their own Necks into the Yoke, out of fear of being forc'd. Yet I may <U+017F>afely affirm for our great Author (as Men of good Sen<U+017F>e are generally Hone<U+017F>t) that he was <U+017F>till of Republick principles in Heart.</p>
                  <q>Secreti<U+017F>que Piis, his dantem jura Catonem.</q>
                  <p>I think, I need u<U+017F>e no other Argument to ju<U+017F>tify my Opinion, than that of this one Line, taken from the Eighth Book of the <hi>Eneis.</hi> If he had not well <U+017F>tudied his Patron's Temper, it might have Ruin'd him with another Prince. But <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> was not di<U+017F>contented, at lea<U+017F>t that we can find, that <hi>Cato</hi> was plac'd, by his own Poet, in <hi>Eli<U+017F>ium;</hi> and there giving Laws to the Holy Souls, who de<U+017F>erv'd to be <U+017F>eparated from the Vulgar <U+017F>ort of good Spirits. For his Con<U+017F>cience could not but whi<U+017F>per to the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Monarch, that the Kings of <hi>Rome</hi> were at fir<U+017F>t Elective, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd not without a Senate: That <hi>Romulus</hi> was no Hereditary Prince, and though, after his Death, he receiv'd Divine Honours, for the good he did on Earth, yet he was but a God of their own making: that the la<U+017F>t <hi>Tarquin</hi> was Expell'd ju<U+017F>tly, for Overt-Acts of Tyranny, and Male-Admini<U+017F>tration; for <U+017F>uch are the Conditions of an Elective Kingdom: And I meddle not with others: being, for my own Opinion, of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigns</hi> Principles, that an Hone<U+017F>t Man ought to be contented with that Form of Government, and with tho<U+017F>e Fundamental Con<U+017F>titutions of it, which he receiv'd from his Ance<U+017F>tors, and under which him<U+017F>elf was
<pb facs="tcp:43031:142"/>
Born: Though at the <U+017F>ame time he confe<U+017F>s'd freely, that if he could have cho<U+017F>en his Place of Birth, it <U+017F>hou'd have been at <hi>Venice:</hi> Which for many Rea<U+017F>ons I di<U+017F>like, and am better pleas'd to have been born an <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Man.</p>
                  <p>But to return from my long rambling: I <U+017F>ay that <hi>Virgil</hi> having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely weigh'd the Condition of the Times in which he liv'd: that an entire Liberty was not to be retriev'd: that the pre<U+017F>ent Settlement had the pro<U+017F>pect of a long continuance in the <U+017F>ame Family, or tho<U+017F>e adopted into it: that he held his Paternal E<U+017F>tate from the Bounty of the Conqueror, by whom he was likewi<U+017F>e enrich'd, e<U+017F>teem'd and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<U+017F>h'd: that this Conquerour, though of a bad kind, was the very be<U+017F>t of it: that the Arts of Peace flouri<U+017F>h'd under him: that all Men might be happy if they would be quiet: that now he was in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of the whole, yet he <U+017F>har'd a great part of his Authority with the Senate: That he would be cho<U+017F>en into the Ancient Offices of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and Rul'd by the Power which he deriv'd from them; and Prorogu'd his Government from time to time: Still, as it were, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to di<U+017F>mi<U+017F>s him<U+017F>elf from Publick Cares, which he exercis'd more for the common Good, than for any delight he took in greatne<U+017F>s: The<U+017F>e things, I <U+017F>ay, being con<U+017F>ider'd by the Poet, he concluded it to be the Intere<U+017F>t of his Country to be <U+017F>o Govern'd: To infu<U+017F>e an awful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pect into the People, towards <U+017F>uch a Prince: By that re<U+017F>pect to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their Obedience to him; and by that Obedience to make them Happy. This was the Moral of his Divine Poem: Hone<U+017F>t in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et: Honourable to the Emperour, whom he derives from a Divine Extraction; and reflecting part of that Honour on the <hi>Roman</hi> People, whom he derives al<U+017F>o from the <hi>Trojans;</hi> and not only profitable, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary to the pre<U+017F>ent Age; and likely to be <U+017F>uch to their Po<U+017F>terity. That it was the receiv'd Opinion, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were de<U+017F>cended from the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and <hi>Julius Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> from <hi>Julus</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> was enough for <hi>Virgil;</hi> tho' perhaps he thought not <U+017F>o him<U+017F>elf: Or that <hi>Aeneas</hi> ever was in <hi>Italy,</hi> which <hi>Bochartus</hi> manife<U+017F>tly proves. And <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> where he <U+017F>ays that <hi>Jupiter</hi> hated the Hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Priam,</hi> and was re<U+017F>olv'd to transfer the Kingdom to the Family of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> yet mentions nothing of his leading a Colony into a Foreign Country, and <U+017F>etling there: But that the <hi>Romans</hi> valued them<U+017F>elves on their <hi>Trojan</hi> Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>try, is <U+017F>o undoubted a Truth, that I need not prove it. Even the Seals which we have remaining of <hi>Julius Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> which we know to be Antique, have the Star of <hi>Venus</hi> over them, though they were all graven after his Death, as a Note that he was Deifi'd. I doubt not but it was one Rea<U+017F>on, why <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> <U+017F>hould be <U+017F>o pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the pre<U+017F>ervation of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> which its Author had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to be Burnt, as an Imperfect Poem, by his la<U+017F>t Will and Te<U+017F>tament; was, becau<U+017F>e it did him a real Service as well as an Honour; that a Work <U+017F>hould not be lo<U+017F>t where his Divine Original was Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Ver<U+017F>e, which had the Character of Immortality <U+017F>tamp'd upon it.</p>
                  <p>Neither were the great <hi>Roman</hi> Families which flouri<U+017F>h'd in his time, le<U+017F>s oblig'd by him than the Emperour. Your Lord<U+017F>hip knows with what Addre<U+017F>s he makes mention of them, as Captains of Ships, or Leaders in the War; and even <U+017F>ome of <hi>Italian</hi> Extraction are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. The<U+017F>e are the <U+017F>ingle Stars which are <U+017F>prinkled through the <hi>Aeneis:</hi> But there are whole Con<U+017F>tellations of them in the Fifth Book. And I could not but take notice, when I Tran<U+017F>lated it, of <U+017F>ome Favourite
<pb facs="tcp:43031:142"/>
Families to which he gives the Victory, and awards the Prizes, in the Per<U+017F>on of his Heroe, at the Funeral Games which were Celebrated in Honour of <hi>Anchi<U+017F>es.</hi> I, In<U+017F>i<U+017F>t not on their Names: But am pleas'd to find the <hi>Memmii</hi> among<U+017F>t them, deriv'd from <hi>Mne<U+017F>theus,</hi> becau<U+017F>e <hi>Lucretius</hi> Dedicates to one of that Family, a Branch of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>troy'd <hi>Corinth.</hi> I likewi<U+017F>e either found or form'd an Image to my <U+017F>elf of the contrary kind; that tho<U+017F>e who lo<U+017F>t the Prizes, were <U+017F>uch as had di<U+017F>oblig'd the Poet, or were in di<U+017F>grace with <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to <hi>Mecenas:</hi> And this was the Poetical Revenge he took. For <hi>genus irritabile Vatum,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> <U+017F>ays. When a Poet is throughly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd, he will do him<U+017F>elf Ju<U+017F>tice, however dear it co<U+017F>t him, <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamque, in Vulnere ponit.</hi> I think the<U+017F>e are not bare Imaginations of my own, though I find no trace of them in the Commentatours: But one Poet may judge of another by him<U+017F>elf. The Vengeance we defer, is not forgotten. I hinted before, that the whole <hi>Roman</hi> People were oblig'd by <hi>Virgil,</hi> in deriving them from <hi>Troy;</hi> an Ance<U+017F>try which they affected. We, and the <hi>French</hi> are of the <U+017F>ame Humour: They would be thought to de<U+017F>cend from a Son, I think, of <hi>Hector:</hi> And we wou'd have our <hi>Britain,</hi> both Nam'd and Planted by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cendant of <hi>Aeneas. Spencer</hi> favours this Opinion what he can. His Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> or whoever he intends by him, is a <hi>Trojan.</hi> Thus the Heroe of <hi>Homer</hi> was a <hi>Grecian,</hi> of <hi>Virgil</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> of <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o</hi> an <hi>Italian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have tran<U+017F>gre<U+017F>s'd my Bounds, and gone farther than the Moral led me. But if your Lord<U+017F>hip is not tir'd, I am <U+017F>afe enough.</p>
                  <p>Thus far, I think, my Author is defended. But as <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> is <U+017F>till <U+017F>hadow'd in the Per<U+017F>on of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> of which I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay more, when I come to the Manners which the Poet gives his Hero: I mu<U+017F>t prepare that Subject by <U+017F>hewing how dext'rou<U+017F>ly he mannag'd both the Prince and People, <U+017F>o as to di<U+017F>plea<U+017F>e neither, and to do good to both, which is the part of a Wi<U+017F>e and an Hone<U+017F>t Man: And proves that it is po<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ible for a Courtier not to be a Knave: I <U+017F>hall continue <U+017F>till to <U+017F>peak my Thoughts like a free-born Subject as I am; though <U+017F>uch things, perhaps, as no <hi>Dutch</hi> Commentator cou'd, and I am <U+017F>ure no <hi>French-</hi>man dur<U+017F>t. I have already told your Lord<U+017F>hip my Opinion of <hi>Virgil;</hi> that he was no Arbitrary Man. Oblig'd he was to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter for his Bounty, and he repays him with good Coun<U+017F>el, how to behave him<U+017F>elf in his new Monarchy, <U+017F>o as to gain the Affections of his Subjects, and de<U+017F>erve to be call'd the Father of his Country. From this Con<U+017F>ideration it is, that he cho<U+017F>e for the ground-work of his Poem, one Empire de<U+017F>troy'd, and another rais'd from the Ruins of it. This was ju<U+017F>t the Parallel. <hi>Aeneas</hi> cou'd not pretend to be <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>'s Heir in a Lineal Succe<U+017F><U+017F>ion: For <hi>Anchi<U+017F>es</hi> the Heroe's Father, was only of the <U+017F>econd Branch of the Royal Family: And <hi>Helenus,</hi> a Son of <hi>Priam,</hi> was yet <U+017F>urviving, and might lawfully claim before him. It may be <hi>Virgil</hi> mentions him on that Account. Neither has he forgotten <hi>Atis,</hi> in the Fifth of his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> the Son of <hi>Polites,</hi> young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t Son to <hi>Priam;</hi> who was <U+017F>lain by <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> in the Second Book. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> then, the Favourite Companion of <hi>A<U+017F>canius,</hi> had a better Right than he; tho' I know he was introduc'd by <hi>Virgil,</hi> to do Honour to the Family, from which <hi>Julius Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> was de<U+017F>cended by the Mothers <U+017F>ide. <hi>Aeneas</hi> had only Married <hi>Creu<U+017F>a, Priam</hi>'s Daughter, and by her could have no Title, while any of the Male I<U+017F><U+017F>ue were remaining. In this ca<U+017F>e, the Poet gave him the next Title, which is, that of an Elective King. The remaining <hi>Trojans</hi> cho<U+017F>e him to lead them forth,
<pb facs="tcp:43031:143"/>
and <U+017F>ettle them in <U+017F>ome Foreign Country. <hi>Ilioneus</hi> in his Speech to <hi>Dido,</hi> calls him expre<U+017F>ly by the Name of King. Our Poet, who all this while had <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> in his Eye, had no de<U+017F>ire he <U+017F>hould <U+017F>eem to <U+017F>ucceed by any right of Inheritance, deriv'd from <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ar;</hi> <U+017F>uch a Title being but one degree remov'd from Conque<U+017F>t. For what was introduc'd by force, by force may be remov'd. 'Twas bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the People that they <U+017F>hould give, than he <U+017F>hould take. Since that Gift was indeed no more at bottom than a Tru<U+017F>t. <hi>Virgil</hi> gives us an Example of this, in the Per<U+017F>on of <hi>Mezentius.</hi> He Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd Arbitrarily, he was expell'd: And came to the de<U+017F>erv'd End of all Tyrants. Our Author <U+017F>hews us another <U+017F>ort of King<U+017F>hip in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of <hi>Latinus.</hi> He was de<U+017F>cended from <hi>Saturn,</hi> and as I remember, in the Third Degree. He is de<U+017F>crib'd a ju<U+017F>t and a gracious Prince; <U+017F>olicitous for the Welfare of his People; always Con<U+017F>ulting with his Senate to promote the common Good. We find him at the head of them, when he enters into the Council-Hall. Speaking fir<U+017F>t, but <U+017F>till demanding their Advice, and <U+017F>teering by it as far as the Iniquity of the Times wou'd <U+017F>uffer him. And this is the proper Character of a King by Inheritance, who is born a Father of his Country. <hi>Aeneas,</hi> tho' he Married the Heire<U+017F>s of the Crown, yet claim'd no Title to it during the Life of his Father-in-Law. <hi>Pater arma Latinus habeto,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Words. As for him<U+017F>elf, he was contented to take care of his Country Gods, who were not tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Latium.</hi> Wherein our Divine Author <U+017F>eems to relate to the after practice of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was to adopt the Gods of tho<U+017F>e they Conquer'd, or receiv'd as Members of their Commonwealth. Yet withal, he plainly touches at the Office of the High Prie<U+017F>thood, with which <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> was inve<U+017F>ted: And which made his Per<U+017F>on more Sacred and inviolable, than even the Tribunitial Power. It was not therefore for nothing, that the mo<U+017F>t Judicious of all Poets, made that Office vacant, by the Death of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> in the Second Book of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> for his Heroe ro <U+017F>ucceed in it; and con<U+017F>equently for <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> to enjoy. I know not that any of the Commentatours have taken notice of that pa<U+017F><U+017F>age. If they have not, I am <U+017F>ure they ought: And if they have, I am not indebted to them for the Ob<U+017F>ervation: The words of <hi>Virgil</hi> are very plain.</p>

                  <p>As for <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> or his Uncle <hi>Julius,</hi> claiming by de<U+017F>cent from <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas;</hi> that Title is already out of doors. <hi>Aeneas</hi> <U+017F>ucceeded not, but was Elected. <hi>Troy</hi> was fore-doom'd to fall for ever.</p>

                     <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> 'tis true, had once re<U+017F>olv'd to re-build that City, and there to make the Seat of Empire: But <hi>Horace</hi> writes an Ode on purpo<U+017F>e to deter him from that Thought; declaring the place to be accurs'd, and that the Gods would as often de<U+017F>troy it as it <U+017F>hou'd be rais'd. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Emperour laid a<U+017F>ide a Project <U+017F>o ungrateful to the <hi>Roman</hi> People: But by this, my Lord, we may conclude that he had <U+017F>till his Pedigree in his Head; and had an Itch of being thought a Divine King, if his Poets had not given him better Coun<U+017F>el.</p>
                  <p>I will pa<U+017F>s by many le<U+017F>s material Objections, for want of room to An<U+017F>wer them: What follows next is of great Importance, if the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
<pb facs="tcp:43031:143"/>
can make out their Charge; for 'tis levell'd at the Manners which our Poet gives his Heroe; and which are the <U+017F>ame which were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently <U+017F>een in his <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus.</hi> Tho<U+017F>e Manners were Piety to the Gods, and a dutiful Affection to his Father; Love to his Relations; Care of his People; Courage and Conduct in the Wars; Gratitude to tho<U+017F>e who had oblig'd him; and Ju<U+017F>tice in general to Mankind.</p>
                  <p>Piety, as your Lord<U+017F>hip <U+017F>ees, takes place of all, as the chief part of his Character: And the word in Latin is more full than it can po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be expre<U+017F>t in any Modern Language; for there it comprehends not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Devotion to the Gods, but Filial Love and tender Affection to Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all <U+017F>orts. As in<U+017F>tances of this, the Deities of <hi>Troy</hi> and his own <hi>Penates</hi> are made the Companions of his Flight: They appear to him in his Voyage, and advi<U+017F>e him; and at la<U+017F>t he re-places them in <hi>Italy,</hi> their Native Country. For his Father he takes him on his Back: He leads his little Son, his Wife follows him; but lo<U+017F>ing his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teps through Fear or Ignorance, he goes back into the mid<U+017F>t of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to find her; and leaves not his pur<U+017F>ute 'till her Gho<U+017F>t appears, to forbid his farther <U+017F>earch. I will <U+017F>ay nothing of his Duty to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while he liv'd; his Sorrow for his Death; of the Games in<U+017F>tituted in Honour of his Memory; or <U+017F>eeking him, by his Command, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, in the <hi>Ely<U+017F>ian</hi> Fields. I will not mention his Tenderne<U+017F>s for his Son, which every where is vi<U+017F>ible; Of his rai<U+017F>ing a Tomb for <hi>Polydorus,</hi> the Ob<U+017F>equies for <hi>Mi<U+017F>enus,</hi> his pious remembrance of <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phobus:</hi> The Funerals of his Nur<U+017F>e: His Grief for <hi>Pallas,</hi> and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge taken on his Murtherer; whom, otherwi<U+017F>e by his Natural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, he had forgiven: And then the Poem had been left imperfect: For we could have had no certain pro<U+017F>pect of his Happine<U+017F>s, while the la<U+017F>t Ob<U+017F>tacle to it was unremov'd. Of the other parts which compo<U+017F>e his Character, as a King, or as a General, I need <U+017F>ay nothing: The whole <hi>Aeneis</hi> is one continued In<U+017F>tance, of <U+017F>ome one or other of them: And where I find any thing of them tax'd, it <U+017F>hall <U+017F>uffice me, as brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can, to vindicate my Divine Ma<U+017F>ter to your Lord<U+017F>hip, and by you to the Reader. But herein, <hi>Segrais,</hi> in his admirable Preface to his Tran<U+017F>lation of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> as the Author of the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s <hi>Virgil</hi> ju<U+017F>tly calls it; has prevented me. Him I follow; and what I borrow from him, am ready to acknowledge to him. For, impartially <U+017F>peaking, the <hi>French</hi> are as much better Criticks than the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h,</hi> as they are wor<U+017F>e Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. Thus we generally allow that they better under<U+017F>tand the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of a War, than our I<U+017F>landers; but we know we are <U+017F>uperiour to them, in the day of Battel. They value them<U+017F>elves on their Generals; we on our Souldiers. But this is not the proper place to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide that Que<U+017F>tion, if they make it one. I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ayperhaps as much of other Nations, and their Poets, excepting only <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o:</hi> and hope to make my A<U+017F><U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion good, which is but doing Ju<U+017F>tice to my Country. Part of which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will reflect on your Lord<U+017F>hip, who<U+017F>e Thoughts are always ju<U+017F>t; your Numbers harmonious; your Words cho<U+017F>en; your Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions <U+017F>trong and manly; your Ver<U+017F>e flowing, and your turns as happy as they are ea<U+017F>ie. If you wou'd <U+017F>et us more Copies, your Example would make all Precepts needle<U+017F>s. In the mean time, that little you have Written is own'd, and that particularly by the Poets, (who are a Nation not over-lavi<U+017F>h of prai<U+017F>e to their Contemporaries,) as a principal Ornament of our Language: But the <U+017F>weete<U+017F>t E<U+017F><U+017F>ences are always confin'd in the <U+017F>mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>t Gla<U+017F><U+017F>es.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:144"/>
When I <U+017F>peak of your Lord<U+017F>hip, 'tis never a digre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I need beg no pardon for it; but take up <hi>Segrais</hi> where I left him: And <U+017F>hall u<U+017F>e him le<U+017F>s often than I have occa<U+017F>ion for him. For his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face is a perfect piece of Critici<U+017F>m, full and clear, and dige<U+017F>ted into an exact Method; mine is loo<U+017F>e, and, as I intended it, Epi<U+017F>tolary. Yet I dwell on many things which he dur<U+017F>t not touch: For 'tis dangerous to offend an Arbitrary Ma<U+017F>ter: And every Patron who has the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> has not his Clemency. In <U+017F>hort, my Lord, I wou'd not Tran<U+017F>late him, becau<U+017F>e I wou'd bring you <U+017F>omewhat of my own. His Notes and Ob<U+017F>ervations on every Book, are of the <U+017F>ame Excellency; and for the <U+017F>ame Rea<U+017F>on I omit the greater part.</p>
                  <p>He takes notice that <hi>Virgil</hi> is Arraign'd for placing Piety before Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and making that Piety the chief Character of his Heroe. I have <U+017F>aid already from <hi>Bo<U+017F><U+017F>u,</hi> that a Poet is not oblig'd to make his Heroe a Virtuous Man: Therefore neither <hi>Homer</hi> nor <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o</hi> are to be blam'd, for giving what predominant quality they pleas'd to their fir<U+017F>t Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. But <hi>Virgil,</hi> who de<U+017F>ign'd to form a perfect Prince, and would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>inuate, that <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Aeneas</hi> in his Poem, was truly <U+017F>uch, found him<U+017F>elf oblig'd to make him without blemi<U+017F>h; thoroughly Virtuous; and a thorough Virtue both begins and ends in Piety. <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o,</hi> without que<U+017F>tion, ob<U+017F>erv'd this before me; and therefore <U+017F>plit his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe in two. He gave <hi>Godfrey</hi> Piety, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> Fortitude; for their chief Qualities or Manners. <hi>Homer,</hi> who had cho<U+017F>en another Moral, makes both <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> vicious: For his de<U+017F>ign was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>truct in Virtue, by <U+017F>hewing the deformity of Vice. I avoid repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one of that I have <U+017F>aid above. What follows is Tran<U+017F>lated literally from <hi>Segrais.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> had con<U+017F>ider'd that the greate<U+017F>t Virtues of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> con<U+017F>i<U+017F>ted in the perfect Art of Governing his People; which caus'd him to Reign for more than Forty Years in great Felicity. He con<U+017F>ider'd that his Emperour was Valiant, Civil, Popular, Eloquent, Politick, and Religious. He has given all the<U+017F>e Qualities to <hi>Aeneas.</hi> But knowing that Piety alone comprehends the whole Duty of Man towards the Gods; towards his County, and towards his Relations, he judg'd, that this ought to be his fir<U+017F>t Character, whom he would <U+017F>et for a Pattern of Perfection. In reality, they who believe that the Prai<U+017F>es which ari<U+017F>e from Valour, are <U+017F>uperiour to tho<U+017F>e, which proceed from any other Virtues, have not con<U+017F>ider'd (as they ought), that Valour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>titute of other Virtues, cannot render a Man worthy of any true e<U+017F>teem. That Quality which <U+017F>ignifies no more than an intrepid Courage, may be <U+017F>eparated from many others which are good, and accompany'd with many which are ill. A Man may be very Valiant, and yet Impious and Vicious. But the <U+017F>ame cannot be <U+017F>aid of Piety; which excludes all ill Qualities, and comprehends even Valour it <U+017F>elf, with all other Qualities which are good. Can we, for Example, give the prai<U+017F>e of Valour to a Man who <U+017F>hou'd <U+017F>ee his Gods prophan'd, and <U+017F>hou'd want the Courage to defend them? To a Man who <U+017F>hou'd abandon his Father, or de<U+017F>ert his King in his la<U+017F>t Nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity?</p>
                  <p>Thus far <hi>Segrais,</hi> in giving the preference to Piety before Valour. I will now follow him, where he con<U+017F>iders this Valour, or intrepid Courage, <U+017F>ingly in it <U+017F>elf; and this al<U+017F>o <hi>Virgil</hi> gives to his <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and that in a Heroical Degree.</p>
                  <p>Having fir<U+017F>t concluded, that our Poet did for the be<U+017F>t in taking the fir<U+017F>t Character of his Heroe, from that E<U+017F><U+017F>ential Vertue on which the
<pb facs="tcp:43031:144"/>
re<U+017F>t depend, he proceeds to tell us, that in the Ten Years war of <hi>Troy,</hi> he was con<U+017F>ider'd as the <U+017F>econd Champion of his Country; allowing <hi>Hector</hi> the fir<U+017F>t place; and this, even by the Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <hi>Homer,</hi> who took all occa<U+017F>ions of <U+017F>etting up his own Countrymen the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and of undervaluing the <hi>Trojan</hi> Chiefs. But <hi>Virgil,</hi> (whom <hi>Segrais</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to cite,) makes <hi>Diomede</hi> give him a higher Character for Strength and Courage. His Te<U+017F>timony is this in the Eleventh Book.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> preferr'd him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ajax,</hi> when he cho<U+017F>e him for the Companion of his Nightly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition: For he had a Head-piece of his own; and wanted only the fortitude of another, to bring him off with <U+017F>afety; and that he might compa<U+017F>s his De<U+017F>ign with Honour.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Tran<U+017F>lator thus proceeds: They who accu<U+017F>e <hi>Aeneas</hi> for want of Courage, either under<U+017F>tand not <hi>Virgil,</hi> or have read him <U+017F>lightly; otherwi<U+017F>e they would not rai<U+017F>e an Objection <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ie to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer'd: Hereupon he gives <U+017F>o many in<U+017F>tances of the Heroe's Valour, that to repeat them after him would tire your Lord<U+017F>hip, and put me to the unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary trouble of Tran<U+017F>cribing the greate<U+017F>t part of the three la<U+017F>t <hi>Aeneids.</hi> In <U+017F>hort, more could not be expected from an <hi>Amadis,</hi> a Sir <hi>Lancelot,</hi> or the whole round Table, than he performs. <hi>Proxima quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que metit gladio,</hi> is the perfect Account of a Knight Errant. If it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>continues Segrais,</hi> that it was not difficult for him to undertake and atchieve <U+017F>uch hardy Enterprizes, becau<U+017F>e he wore Enchanted Arms. That Accu<U+017F>ation, in the fir<U+017F>t place, mu<U+017F>t fall on <hi>Homer</hi> e're it can reach <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil. Achilles</hi> was as well provided with them as <hi>Aeneas,</hi> though he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable without them: And, <hi>Ario<U+017F>to,</hi> the two <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o</hi>'s, <hi>Bernardo</hi> and <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quato,</hi> even our own <hi>Spencer;</hi> in a word, all Modern Poets have Copied <hi>Homer</hi> as well as <hi>Virgil:</hi> He is neither the fir<U+017F>t nor la<U+017F>t; but in the mid<U+017F>t of them; and therefore is <U+017F>afe if they are <U+017F>o. Who knows, <U+017F>ays <hi>Segrais,</hi> but that his fated Armour was only an Allegorical Defence, and <U+017F>ignifi'd no more than that he was under the peculiar protection of the Gods; born, as the <hi>A<U+017F>trologers</hi> will tell us out of <hi>Virgil</hi> (who was well vers'd in the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> My<U+017F>teries) under the favourable influence of <hi>Jupiter, Venus,</hi> and the <hi>Sun:</hi> But I in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t not on this, becau<U+017F>e I know you believe not
<pb facs="tcp:43031:145"/>
there is <U+017F>uch an Art: though not only <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Per<U+017F>ius,</hi> but <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> him<U+017F>elf, thought otherwi<U+017F>e. But in defence of <hi>Virgil,</hi> I dare po<U+017F>itively <U+017F>ay, that he has been more cautious in this particular than either his Predece<U+017F><U+017F>our, or his De<U+017F>cendants. For <hi>Aeneas</hi> was actually wounded, in the Twelfth of the <hi>Aeneis;</hi> though he had the <U+017F>ame God-Smith to Forge his Arms, as had <hi>Achilles.</hi> It <U+017F>eems he was no War-luck, as the <hi>Scots</hi> commonly call <U+017F>uch Men, who they <U+017F>ay, are Iron-free, or Lead-free. Yet after this Experiment, that his Arms were not impenetrable, when he was Cur'd indeed by his Mother's help, becau<U+017F>e he was that day to conclude the War by the death of <hi>Turnus,</hi> the Poet dur<U+017F>t not carry the Miracle too far, and re<U+017F>tore him wholy to his former Vigour: He was <U+017F>till too weak to overtake his Enemy; yet we <U+017F>ee with what Courage he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks <hi>Turnus,</hi> when he faces and renews the Combate. I need <U+017F>ay no more, for <hi>Virgil</hi> defends him<U+017F>elf, without needing my a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance; and proves his Heroe truly to de<U+017F>erve that Name. He was not then a Second-rate Champion, as they would have him, who think Fortitude the fir<U+017F>t Vertue in a Heroe. But being beaten from this hold, they will not yet allow him to be Valiant; becau<U+017F>e he wept more often, as they think, than well becomes a Man of Courage.</p>
                  <p>In the fir<U+017F>t place, if Tears are Arguments of Cowardi<U+017F>e, What <U+017F>hall I <U+017F>ay of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Heroe? <U+017F>hall <hi>Achilles</hi> pa<U+017F>s for timorous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e he wept? and wept on le<U+017F>s occa<U+017F>ions than <hi>Aeneas?</hi> Herein <hi>Virgil</hi> mu<U+017F>t be granted to have excell'd his Ma<U+017F>ter. For once both Heroes are de<U+017F>crib'd lamenting their lo<U+017F>t Loves: <hi>Bri<U+017F>eis</hi> was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by force from the <hi>Grecian: Ceru<U+017F>a</hi> was lo<U+017F>t for ever to her Hu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. But <hi>Achilles</hi> went roaring along the <U+017F>alt Sea-<U+017F>hore, and like a Booby, was complaining to his Mother, when he <U+017F>hou'd have reveng'd his Injury by Arms. <hi>Aeneas</hi> took a Nobler Cour<U+017F>e; for having <U+017F>ecur'd his Father and his Son, he repeated all his former Dangers to have found his Wife, if <U+017F>he had been above ground. And here your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip may ob<U+017F>erve the Addre<U+017F>s of <hi>Virgil;</hi> it was not for nothing, that this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age was related with all the<U+017F>e tender Circum<U+017F>tances. <hi>Aeneas</hi> told it; <hi>Dido</hi> hear'd it: That he had been <U+017F>o affectionate a Husband, was no ill Argument to the coming Dowager, that he might prove as kind to her. <hi>Virgil</hi> has a thou<U+017F>and <U+017F>ecret Beauties, tho' I have not lei<U+017F>ure to remark them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Segrais</hi> on this Subject of a Heroe's <U+017F>hedding Tears, ob<U+017F>erves that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>torians commend <hi>Alexander</hi> for weeping, when he read the mighty Actions of <hi>Achilles.</hi> And <hi>Julius Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> is likewi<U+017F>e prais'd, when out of the <U+017F>ame Noble Envy, he wept at the Victories of <hi>Alexander.</hi> But if we ob<U+017F>erve more clo<U+017F>ely, we <U+017F>hall find, that the tears of <hi>Aeneas</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways on a laudable Occa<U+017F>ion. Thus he weeps out of Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and tenderne<U+017F>s of Nature, when in the Temple of <hi>Carthage</hi> he beholds the Pictures of his Friends, who Sacrific'd their Lives in Defence of their Country. He deplores the lamentable End of his Pilot <hi>Palinurus;</hi> the untimely death of young <hi>Pallas</hi> his Confederate; and the re<U+017F>t, which I omit. Yet even for the<U+017F>e Tears his wretched Criticks dare condemn him. They make <hi>Aeneas</hi> little better than a kind of a St. <hi>Swithen</hi> Heroe, always raining. One of the<U+017F>e Cen<U+017F>ors is bold enough to argue him of Cowardi<U+017F>e; when in the beginning of the Fir<U+017F>t Book, he not only weeps, but trembles at an approaching Storm.</p>

                  <p>But to this I have an<U+017F>wer'd formerly; that his fear was not for him<U+017F>elf, but for his People. And who can give a Soveraign a better Commendation, or recommend a Heroe more to the affection of the Reader? They were threatned with a Tempe<U+017F>t, and he wept; he was promis'd <hi>Italy,</hi> and therefore he pray'd for the accompli<U+017F>hment of that Promi<U+017F>e. All this in the beginning of a Storm, therefore he <U+017F>hew'd the more early Piety, and the quicker <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. Thus much I have urg'd el<U+017F>ewhere in the defence of <hi>Virgil;</hi> and <U+017F>ince I have been inform'd, by Mr. <hi>Moyl,</hi> a young Gentleman, whom I can never <U+017F>ufficiently commend, that the Ancients accounted drowning an accur<U+017F>ed Death. So that if we grant him to have been afraid, he had ju<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ion for that fear, both in relation to him<U+017F>elf, and to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. I think our Adver<U+017F>aries can carry this Argument no farther, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s they tell us that he ought to have had more confidence in the promi<U+017F>e of the Gods: But how was he a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd that he had under<U+017F>tood their Oracles aright? <hi>Helenus</hi> might be mi<U+017F>taken, <hi>Phoebus</hi> might <U+017F>peak doubtfully, even his Mother might flatter him, that he might pro<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his Voyage, which if it <U+017F>ucceeded happily, he <U+017F>hou'd be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of an Empire. For that <U+017F>he her <U+017F>elf was doubtful of his Fortune, is apparent by the Addre<U+017F>s <U+017F>he made to <hi>Jupiter</hi> on his behalf.

They give him two contrary Characters, but <hi>Virgil</hi> makes him of a piece, always grateful, always tender-hearted. But they are impudent enough to di<U+017F>charge them<U+017F>elves of this blunder, by laying the Contradiction at <hi>Virgil</hi>'s door. He, they <U+017F>ay, has <U+017F>hewn his Heroe with the<U+017F>e incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent Characters: Acknowledging, and Ungrateful, Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ionate, and Hard-harted; but at the bottom, Fickle, and Self-intere<U+017F>ted. For <hi>Dido</hi> had not only receiv'd his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-beaten Troops before <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw him, and given them her protection, but had al<U+017F>o offer'd them an equal <U+017F>hare in her Dominion.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I have <U+017F>et this Argument in the be<U+017F>t light I can, that the Ladies may not think I write booty: and perhaps it may happen to me, as it did to Doctor <hi>Cudworth,</hi> who has rais'd <U+017F>uch <U+017F>trong Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons again<U+017F>t the being of a God, and Providence, that many think he has not an<U+017F>wer'd them.

But at the <U+017F>ame time, he does wi<U+017F>ely to remember you, that <hi>Virgil</hi> had made Piety the fir<U+017F>t Character of <hi>Aeneas:</hi> And this being allow'd, as I am afraid it mu<U+017F>t, he was oblig'd, antecedent to all other Con<U+017F>iderations, to <U+017F>earch an <hi>A<U+017F>ylum</hi> for his Gods in <hi>Italy.</hi> For tho<U+017F>e very Gods, I <U+017F>ay, who had promis'd to his Race the Univer<U+017F>al Empire. Cou'd a Pious Man di<U+017F>pence with the Commands of <hi>Jupiter</hi> to <U+017F>atisfie his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; or take it in the <U+017F>tronge<U+017F>t <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, to comply with the obligations of his gratitude? Religion, 'tis true, mu<U+017F>t have Moral Hone<U+017F>ty for its ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, or we <U+017F>hall be apt to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect its truth; but an immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>es with all Duties of Morality. All Ca<U+017F>ui<U+017F>ts agree, that Theft is a breach of the Moral Law: yet if I might pre<U+017F>ume to mingle Things Sacred with Prophane, the <hi>I<U+017F>raelites</hi> only <U+017F>poil'd the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> not rob'd them, becau<U+017F>e the propriety was transferr'd; by a Revelation to their Law-giver.

                  <p>Upon the whole Matter, and humanely <U+017F>peaking, I doubt there was a fault <U+017F>omewhere; and <hi>Jupiter</hi> is better able to bear the blame, than either <hi>Virgil</hi> or <hi>Aeneas.</hi> The Poet it <U+017F>eems had found it out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brings the de<U+017F>erting Heroe and the for<U+017F>aken Lady to meet together in the lower Regions; where he excu<U+017F>es him<U+017F>elf when 'tis too late, and accordingly <U+017F>he will take no <U+017F>atisfaction, nor <U+017F>o much as hear him. Now <hi>Segrais</hi> is forc'd to abandon his defence, and excu<U+017F>es his Author, by <U+017F>aying that the <hi>Aeneis</hi> is an imperfect Work, and that Death prevented the Divine Poet from reviewing it; and for that Rea<U+017F>on he had condemn'd it to the fire; though at the <U+017F>ame time, his two Tran<U+017F>lators mu<U+017F>t acknowledge, that the Sixth Book is the mo<U+017F>t Correct of the whole <hi>Aeneis.</hi> Oh, how convenient is a Machine <U+017F>ometimes in a Heroick Poem! This of <hi>Mercury</hi> is plainly one, and <hi>Virgil</hi> was con<U+017F>train'd to u<U+017F>e it here, or the hone<U+017F>ty of his Heroe

wou'd be ill-defended. And the Fair Sex however, if they had the De<U+017F>ertour in their power, wou'd certainly have <U+017F>hewn him no more mercy, than the <hi>Bacchanals</hi> did <hi>Orpheus.</hi> For if too much Con<U+017F>tancy may be a fault <U+017F>ometimes, then want of Con<U+017F>tancy, and Ingratitude after the la<U+017F>t Favour, is a Crime that never will be forgiven. But of Machines, more in their proper place: where I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>hew, with how much judgment they have been us'd by <hi>Virgil;</hi> and in the mean time pa<U+017F>s to another Article of his defence on the pre<U+017F>ent Subject: where if I cannot clear the Heroe, I hope at lea<U+017F>t to bring off the Poet; for here I mu<U+017F>t divide their Cau<U+017F>es. Let <hi>Aeneas</hi> tru<U+017F>t to his Machine, which will only help to break his Fall, but the Addre<U+017F>s is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Plato,</hi> who borrow'd <U+017F>o much from <hi>Homer,</hi> and yet concluded for the Bani<U+017F>hment of all Poets, wou'd at lea<U+017F>t have Rewarded <hi>Virgil,</hi> before he <U+017F>ent him into Exile. But I go farther, and <U+017F>ay, that he ought to be acquitted, and de<U+017F>erv'd be<U+017F>ide, the Bounty of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<U+017F>tus,</hi> and the gratitude of the <hi>Roman</hi> People. If after this, the Ladies will <U+017F>tand out, let them remember, that the Jury is not all agreed; for <hi>Octavia</hi> was of his Party, and was al<U+017F>o of the fir<U+017F>t Quality in <hi>Rome;</hi> <U+017F>he was pre<U+017F>ent at the reading of the Sixth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> and we know not that <U+017F>he condemn'd <hi>Aeneas;</hi> but we are <U+017F>ure <U+017F>he pre<U+017F>ented the Poet, for his admirable Elegy on her Son <hi>Marcellus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us con<U+017F>ider the <U+017F>ecret Rea<U+017F>ons which <hi>Virgil</hi> had, for thus framing this Noble Epi<U+017F>ode, wherein the whole pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of Love is more exactly de<U+017F>crib'd than in any other Poet. Love was the Theme of his Fourth Book; and though it is the <U+017F>horte<U+017F>t of the whole <hi>Aeneis,</hi> yet there he has given its beginning, its progre<U+017F>s, its traver<U+017F>es, and its conclu<U+017F>ion. And had exhau<U+017F>ted <U+017F>o entirely this Subject, that he cou'd re<U+017F>ume it but very <U+017F>lightly in the Eight en<U+017F>uing Books.</p>
                  <p>She was warm'd with the graceful appearance of the Heroe, <U+017F>he <U+017F>mother'd tho<U+017F>e Sparkles out of decency, but Conver<U+017F>ation blew them up into a Flame. Then <U+017F>he was forc'd to make a Confident of her whom <U+017F>he be<U+017F>t might tru<U+017F>t, her own Si<U+017F>ter, who approves the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and thereby augments it, then <U+017F>ucceeds her publick owning it; and after that, the con<U+017F>ummation. Of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Juno, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> I <U+017F>ay nothing, for they were all Machining work; but po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cool'd his Love, as it increas'd hers, <U+017F>he <U+017F>oon perceiv'd the change, or at lea<U+017F>t grew <U+017F>u<U+017F>picious of a change; this <U+017F>u<U+017F>picion <U+017F>oon turn'd to Jealou<U+017F>ie, and Jealou<U+017F>ie to Rage; then <U+017F>he di<U+017F>dains and threatens, and again is humble, and intreats; and nothing availing, de<U+017F>pairs, cur<U+017F>es, and at la<U+017F>t becomes her own Executioner. See here the whole proce<U+017F>s of that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, to which nothing can be added. I dare go no farther, le<U+017F>t I <U+017F>hou'd lo<U+017F>e the connection of my Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e.</p>
                  <p>To love our Native Country, and to <U+017F>tudy its Benefit and its Glory, to be intere<U+017F><U+017F>ed in its Concerns, is Natural to all Men, and is indeed our common Duty. A Poet makes a farther <U+017F>tep; for endeavouring to do honour to it, 'tis allowable in him even to be partial in its Cau<U+017F>e; for he is not ty'd to truth, or fetter'd by the Laws of Hi<U+017F>tory. <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o</hi> are ju<U+017F>tly prais'd for chu<U+017F>ing their Heroes out of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy; Virgil</hi> indeed made his a <hi>Trojan,</hi> but it was to derive the <hi>Romans,</hi> and his own <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> from him; but all the three Poets are manife<U+017F>tly partial to their Heroes, in favour of their Country. For <hi>Dares Phrygius</hi> reports of <hi>Hector,</hi> that he was <U+017F>lain Cowardly; <hi>Aeneas</hi> according to the be<U+017F>t account, <U+017F>lew not <hi>Mezentius,</hi> but was <U+017F>lain by him: and the Chronicles of <hi>Italy</hi> tell us little of that <hi>Rinaldo d'E<U+017F>tè</hi>

who Conquers <hi>Jeru<U+017F>alem</hi> in <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o.</hi> He might be a Champion of the Church; but we know not that he was <U+017F>o much as pre<U+017F>ent at the Siege. To ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to <hi>Virgil,</hi> he thought him<U+017F>elf engag'd in Honour to e<U+017F>pou<U+017F>e the Cau<U+017F>e and Quarrel of his Country again<U+017F>t <hi>Carthage.</hi> He knew he cou'd not plea<U+017F>e the <hi>Romans</hi> better, or oblige them more to Patronize his Poem, than by di<U+017F>gracing the Foundre<U+017F>s of that City. He <U+017F>hews her ungrateful to the Memory of her fir<U+017F>t Husband, doting on a Stranger; enjoy'd, and afterwards for<U+017F>aken by him. This was the Original, <U+017F>ays he, of the immortal hatred betwixt the two Rival Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 'Tis true, he colours the fal<U+017F>ehood of <hi>Aeneas</hi> by an expre<U+017F>s Command from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to for<U+017F>ake the Queen, who had oblig'd him: but he knew the <hi>Romans</hi> were to be his Readers, and them he brib'd, perhaps at the expence of his Heroe's hone<U+017F>ty, but he gain'd his Cau<U+017F>e however; as Pleading before Corrupt Judges. They were content to <U+017F>ee their Founder fal<U+017F>e to Love, for <U+017F>till he had the advantage of the Amour: It was their Enemy whom he for<U+017F>ook, and <U+017F>he might have for<U+017F>aken him, if he had not got the <U+017F>tart of her: <U+017F>he had already for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten her Vows to her <hi>Sichaeus;</hi> and <hi>varium &amp; mutabile <U+017F>emper femina,</hi> is the <U+017F>harpe<U+017F>t Satire in the fewe<U+017F>t words that was ever made on Womankind; for both the Adjectives are Neuter, and <hi>Animal</hi> mu<U+017F>t be under<U+017F>tood, to make them Grammar. <hi>Virgil</hi> does well to put tho<U+017F>e words into the mouth of <hi>Mercury. If a God had not <U+017F>poken them, neither dur<U+017F>t he have written them, nor I tran<U+017F>lated them.</hi> Yet the Deity was forc'd to come twice on the <U+017F>ame Errand: and the <U+017F>econd time, as much a Heroe as <hi>Aeneas</hi> was, he frighted him. It <U+017F>eems he fear'd not <hi>Jupiter</hi> <U+017F>o much as <hi>Dido.</hi> For your Lord<U+017F>hip may ob<U+017F>erve, that as much intent as he was upon his Voyage, yet he <U+017F>till delay'd it, 'till the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enger was oblig'd to tell him plainly, that if he weigh'd not Anchor in the Night, the Queen wou'd be with him in the Morning. <hi>Notum<expan>

The God <U+017F>oon found that he was not able to defend his Favourite by Rea<U+017F>on, for the Ca<U+017F>e was clear: he therefore gave this middle Sentence; That any thing might be allow'd to his Son <hi>Virgil</hi> on the account of his other Merits; That being a Monarch he had a di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ing Power, and pardon'd him. But that this <U+017F>pecial Act of Grace might never be drawn into Example, or pleaded by his puny Succe<U+017F><U+017F>ors, in ju<U+017F>tification of their ignorance; he decreed for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, No Poet <U+017F>hou'd pre<U+017F>ume to make a Lady die for Love two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before her Birth. To Moralize this Story, <hi>Virgil</hi> is the <hi>Apollo,</hi> who has this Di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>ing Power.

I think I may be Judge of this, becau<U+017F>e I have Tran<U+017F>lated both. The Famous Author of the Art of Love has nothing of his own, he borrows all from a greater Ma<U+017F>ter in his own profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion; and which is wor<U+017F>e, improves nothing which he finds. Nature fails him, and being forc'd to his old <U+017F>hift, he has recour<U+017F>e to Wittici<U+017F>m. This pa<U+017F><U+017F>es indeed with his Soft Admirers, and gives him the preference to <hi>Virgil</hi> in their e<U+017F>teem. But let them like for them<U+017F>elves, and not pre<U+017F>cribe to others, for our Author needs not their Admiration.</p>
                  <p>The Motives that induc'd <hi>Virgil</hi> to Coyn this Fable, I have <U+017F>hew'd already; and have al<U+017F>o begun to <U+017F>hew that he might make this <hi>Anacro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<U+017F>m,</hi> by <U+017F>uper<U+017F>eding the mechanick Rules of Poetry, for the <U+017F>ame Rea<U+017F>on, that a Monarch may di<U+017F>pen<U+017F>e with, or <U+017F>u<U+017F>pend his own Laws, when he finds it nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary <U+017F>o to do; e<U+017F>pecially if tho<U+017F>e Laws are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fundamental. Nothing is to be call'd a fault in Poetry, <U+017F>ays <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> but what is again<U+017F>t the Art; therefore a Man may be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Poet, without being an exact Chronologer. Shall we dare, continues <hi>Segrais,</hi> to condemn <hi>Virgil,</hi> for having made a Fiction again<U+017F>t the order of time, when we commend <hi>Ovid</hi> and other Poets who have made many of their Fictions again<U+017F>t the Order of Nature? For what are el<U+017F>e the <U+017F>plendid Miracles of the Metamorpho<U+017F>es? Yet the<U+017F>e are Beautiful as they are related; and have al<U+017F>o deep Learning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructive Mythologies couch'd under them: But to give, as <hi>Virgil</hi> does in this Epi<U+017F>ode, the Original Cau<U+017F>e of the long Wars betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> to draw Truth out of Fiction, after <U+017F>o probable a manner, with <U+017F>o much Beauty, and <U+017F>o much for the Honour of his Country, was proper only to the Divine Wit of <hi>Maro;</hi> and <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o</hi> in one of his Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, admires him for this particularly. 'Tis not lawful indeed, to contradict a Point of Hi<U+017F>tory, which is known to all the World; as for Example, to make <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries with <hi>Alexander;</hi> but in the dark Rece<U+017F><U+017F>es of Antiquity, a great Poet may and ought to feign <U+017F>uch things as he finds not there, if they can be brought to embeli<U+017F>h that Subject which he treats. On the other <U+017F>ide, the pains and diligence of ill Poets is but thrown away, when they want the Genius to invent and feign agreeably. But if the Fictions be delightful, which they always are, if they be natural, if they be of a piece; if the beginning, the middle, and the end be in their due places, and artfully united to each other, <U+017F>uch Works can never fail of their de<U+017F>erv'd Succe<U+017F>s. And <U+017F>uch is <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Epi<U+017F>ode of
<pb facs="tcp:43031:148"/>
                     <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Aeneas;</hi> where the <U+017F>oure<U+017F>t Critick mu<U+017F>t acknowledge' that if he had depriv'd his <hi>Aeneis</hi> of <U+017F>o great an Ornament, becau<U+017F>e he found no traces of it in Antiquity, he had avoided their unju<U+017F>t Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure, but had wanted one of the greate<U+017F>t Beauties of his Poem. I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay more of this, in the next Article of their Charge again<U+017F>t him, which is want of Invention. In the mean time I may affirm in honour of this Epi<U+017F>ode, that it is not only now e<U+017F>teem'd the mo<U+017F>t plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing entertainment of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> but was <U+017F>o accounted in his own Age; and before it was mellow'd into that reputation, which time has given it; for which I need produce no other te<U+017F>timony, than that of <hi>Ovid,</hi> his Contemporary.</p>

May I be <U+017F>o bold to ask your Maje<U+017F>ty, is it a greater fault to teach the Art of unlawful Love, than to <U+017F>hew it in the Action? But was <hi>Ovid</hi> the Court-Poet <U+017F>o bad a Courtier, as to find no other Plea to excu<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf, than by a plain accu<U+017F>ation of his Ma<U+017F>ter? <hi>Virgil</hi> confe<U+017F>s'd it was a Lawful Marriage betwixt the Lovers; that <hi>Juno</hi> the Godde<U+017F>s of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony had ratify'd it by her pre<U+017F>ence, for it was her bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to bring Matters to that i<U+017F><U+017F>ue.

                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>xorius</hi> implies. Now mark a little, if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip plea<U+017F>es, why <hi>Virgil</hi> is <U+017F>o much concern'd to make this Marriage (for he <U+017F>eems to be the Father of the Bride him<U+017F>elf, and to give her to the Bridegroom) it was to make way for the Divorce which he intended af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; for he was a finer Flatterer than <hi>Ovid:</hi> and I more than conjecture that he had in his eye the Divorce which not long before had pa<U+017F>s'd betwixt the Emperour and <hi>Scribonia.</hi> He drew this dimple in the Cheek of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> to prove <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> of the <U+017F>ame Family, by <U+017F>o remarkable a Feature in the <U+017F>ame place. Thus, as we <U+017F>ay in our home-<U+017F>pun <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Proverb, <hi>He kill'd two Birds with one <U+017F>tone;</hi> pleas'd the Emperour by giving him the re<U+017F>emblance of his Ance<U+017F>tor; and gave him <U+017F>uch a re<U+017F>emblance as was not <U+017F>candalous in that Age. For to leave one Wife and take another, was but a matter of Gallantry at that time of day among the <hi>Romans. Neque haec in faedera veni,</hi> is the very Excu<U+017F>e which <hi>Aeneas</hi> makes, when he leaves his Lady. I made no <U+017F>uch Bargain with you at our Marriage, to live always drudging on at <hi>Carthage;</hi> my bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was <hi>Italy,</hi> and I never made a <U+017F>ecret of it. If I took my plea<U+017F>ure, had not you your <U+017F>hare of it? I leave you free at my departure, to comfort your <U+017F>elf with the next Stranger who happens to be Shipwreck'd on your Coa<U+017F>t. Be as kind an Ho<U+017F>te<U+017F>s as

you have been to me, and you can never fail of another Husband. In the mean time, I call the Gods to witne<U+017F>s, that I leave your Shore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly; for though <hi>Juno</hi> made the Marriage, yet <hi>Jupiter</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to for<U+017F>ake you.

If the Poet argued not aright, we mu<U+017F>t pardon him for a poor blind Heathen, who knew no better Morals.</p>
                  <p>I have detain'd your Lord<U+017F>hip longer than I intended on this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: Which wou'd indeed weigh <U+017F>omething in a Spiritual Court; but I am not to defend our Poet there. The next I think is but a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, though the Cry is great again<U+017F>t him, and has continu'd from the time of <hi>Macrobius</hi> to this pre<U+017F>ent Age. I hinted it before. They lay no le<U+017F>s than want of Invention to his Charge. A capital Crime I mu<U+017F>t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. For a Poet is a Maker, as the word <U+017F>ignifies: And who cannot make, that is, invent, has his Name for nothing. That which makes this Accu<U+017F>ation look <U+017F>o <U+017F>trange at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight, is, That he has borrow'd <U+017F>o many things from <hi>Homer, Appollonius Rhodius,</hi> and others who preceded him. But in the fir<U+017F>t place, if Invention is to be taken in <U+017F>o <U+017F>trict a <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, that the Matter of a Poem mu<U+017F>t be wholly new, and that in all its Parts; then <hi>Scaliger</hi> has made out, <U+017F>ays <hi>Segrais,</hi> that the Hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Troy</hi> was no more the Invention of <hi>Homer,</hi> than of <hi>Virgil.</hi> There was not an Old Woman, or almo<U+017F>t a Child, but had it in their Mouths, before the Greek Poet or his Friends dige<U+017F>ted it into this admirable order in which we read it. At this rate, as <hi>Solomon</hi> has told us, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new beneath the Sun: Who then can pa<U+017F>s for an Inventor, if <hi>Homer,</hi> as well as <hi>Virgil</hi> mu<U+017F>t be depriv'd of that Glory? Is <hi>Ver<U+017F>ailles</hi> the le<U+017F>s a New Building, becau<U+017F>e the Architect of that Palace has imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted others which were built before it? Walls, Doors and Windows, Apartments, Offices, Rooms of convenience and Magnificence, are in all great Hou<U+017F>es. So De<U+017F>criptions Figures, Fables, and the re<U+017F>t, mu<U+017F>t be in all Heroick Poems. They are the Common Materials of Poetry, furni<U+017F>h'd from the Magazine of Nature: Every Poet has as much right to them, as every Man has to Air or Water. <hi>Quid prohibetis Aquas? <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g><U+017F>us communis aquarum e<U+017F>t.</hi> But the Argument of the Work, that is to <U+017F>ay, its principal Action, the Oeconomy and Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of it; the<U+017F>e are the things which di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h Copies from Originals. The Poet, who borrows nothing from others, is yet to be Born. He and the <hi>Jews</hi> Me<U+017F><U+017F>ias will come together. There are parts of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emble <U+017F>ome parts both of the <hi>Ilias</hi> and of the <hi>Ody<U+017F><U+017F>es;</hi> as for Example, <hi>Aeneas</hi> de<U+017F>cended into Hell, and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> had been there before him: <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> lov'd <hi>Dido,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> lov'd <hi>Calyp<U+017F>o:</hi> In few words, <hi>Virgil</hi> has imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated <hi>Homer</hi>'s Ody<U+017F><U+017F>es in his fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ix Books, and in his <U+017F>ix la<U+017F>t the <hi>Ilias.</hi> But from hence can we infer, that the two Poets write the <U+017F>ame Hi<U+017F>tory? Is there no invention in <U+017F>ome other parts of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Aeneis?</hi> The di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of <U+017F>o many various matters, is not that his own? From what Book of <hi>Homer</hi> had <hi>Virgil</hi> his <hi>Epi<U+017F>ode</hi> of <hi>Ny<U+017F>us</hi> and <hi>Euryalus,</hi> of <hi>Mezentius</hi> and <hi>Lau<U+017F>us?</hi> From whence did he borrow his De<U+017F>ign of bringing <hi>Aeneas</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> of E<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire on the Foundations of a <hi>Trojan</hi> Colony; to <U+017F>ay nothing of the honour he did his Patron, not only in his de<U+017F>cent from <hi>Venus,</hi> but in making him <U+017F>o like him in his be<U+017F>t Features, that the Godde<U+017F>s might have mi<U+017F>taken <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> for her Son. He had indeed the Story from common Fame, as <hi>Homer</hi> had his from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prie<U+017F>te<U+017F>s. <hi>Aeneadum Genetrix</hi> was no more unknown to <hi>Lucretius</hi> than to him. But <hi>Lucretius</hi> taught him
<pb facs="tcp:43031:149"/>
not to form his Heroe; to give him Piety or Valour for his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and both in <U+017F>o eminent a degree, that having done what was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible for Man, to <U+017F>ave his King and Country; his Mother was forc'd to appear to him and re<U+017F>train his Fury, which hurry'd him to death in their Revenge. But the Poet made his Piety more <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful; he brought off his Father and his Son; and his Gods witne<U+017F>s'd to his Devotion, by putting them<U+017F>elves under his Protection; to be re-plac'd by him in their promis'd <hi>Italy.</hi> Neither the Invention, nor the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this great Action, were owing to <hi>Homer</hi> or any other Poet. 'Tis one thing to Copy, and another thing to imitate from Nature. The Copyer is that <U+017F>ervile Imitator, to whom <hi>Horace</hi> gives no better a Name than that of Animal: He will not <U+017F>o much as allow him to be a Man. <hi>Raphael</hi> imitated Nature: They who Copy one of <hi>Raphael</hi>'s Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, imitate but him, for his Work is their Original. They Tran<U+017F>late him as I do <hi>Virgil;</hi> and fall as <U+017F>hort of him as I of <hi>Virgil.</hi> There is a kind of Invention in the imitation of <hi>Raphael;</hi> for though the thing was in Nature, yet the Idea of it was his own. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> Travell'd, <U+017F>o did <hi>Aeneas;</hi> but neither of them were the fir<U+017F>t Travellers; for <hi>Cain</hi> went into the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> before they were born: And neither of the Poets ever heard of <U+017F>uch a Man. If <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> had been kill'd at <hi>Troy,</hi> yet <hi>Aeneas</hi> mu<U+017F>t have gone to Sea, or he could never have arriv'd in <hi>Italy.</hi> But the de<U+017F>igns of the two Poets were as different as the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es of their Heroes; one went Home, and the other <U+017F>ought a Home. To return to my fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>imilitude: Suppo<U+017F>e <hi>Apelles</hi> and <hi>Raphael</hi> had each of them Painted a burning <hi>Troy;</hi> might not the Modern Painter have <U+017F>ucceeded as well as the Ancient, tho' neither of them had <U+017F>een the Town on Fire? For the draughts of both were taken from the Idea's which they had of Nature. Cities had been burnt before either of them were in Being. But to Clo<U+017F>e the Simile as I begun it; they wou'd not have de<U+017F>ign'd after the <U+017F>ame manner. <hi>Apelles</hi> wou'd have di<U+017F>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui<U+017F>h'd <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> from the re<U+017F>t of all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and <U+017F>hew'd him forcing his entrance into <hi>Priam</hi>'s Palace; there he had <U+017F>et him in the faire<U+017F>t Light, and given him the chief place of all his Figures, becau<U+017F>e he was a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and he wou'd do Honour to his Country. <hi>Raphael,</hi> who was an <hi>Italian,</hi> and de<U+017F>cended from the <hi>Trojans,</hi> wou'd have made <hi>Aeneas</hi> the Heroe of his piece: And perhaps not with his Father on his Back; his Son in one hand, his Bundle of Gods in the other, and his Wife fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; (for an Act of Piety, is not half <U+017F>o graceful in a Picture as an Act of Courage:) He would rather have drawn him killing <hi>Androgeos,</hi> or <U+017F>ome other, Hand to Hand; and the blaze of the Fires <U+017F>hou'd have darted full upon his Face, to make him con<U+017F>picuous among<U+017F>t his <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans.</hi> This I think is a ju<U+017F>t Compari<U+017F>on betwixt the two Poets in the Conduct of their <U+017F>everal de<U+017F>igns. <hi>Virgil</hi> cannot be <U+017F>aid to copy <hi>Homer:</hi> The <hi>Grecian</hi> had only the advantage of writing fir<U+017F>t. If it be urg'd that I have granted a re<U+017F>emblance in <U+017F>ome parts; yet therein <hi>Virgil</hi> has excell'd him: For what are the Tears of <hi>Calyp<U+017F>o</hi> for being left, to the Fury and Death of <hi>Dido?</hi> Where is there the whole proce<U+017F>s of her Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and all its violent Effects to be found, in the langui<U+017F>hing <hi>Epi<U+017F>ode</hi> of the <hi>Ody<U+017F><U+017F>es?</hi> If this be to Copy, let the Criticks <U+017F>hew us the <U+017F>ame Di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, Features, or Colouring in their Original. The like may be <U+017F>aid of the De<U+017F>cent to Hell; which was not of <hi>Homer</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention neither: He had it from the Story of <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Eurydice.</hi> But to what end did <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>ly<U+017F><U+017F>es</hi> make that Journey? <hi>Aeneas</hi> undertook it by the expre<U+017F>s Commandment of his Father's Gho<U+017F>t: There he was to
<pb facs="tcp:43031:150"/>
<U+017F>hew him all the <U+017F>ucceeding Heroes of his Race; and next to <hi>Romulus,</hi> (mark, if you plea<U+017F>e, the Addre<U+017F>s of <hi>Virgil)</hi> his own Patron <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus Cae<U+017F>ar. Anchi<U+017F>es</hi> was likewi<U+017F>e to in<U+017F>truct him, how to manage the <hi>Italian</hi> War; and how to conclude it with his Honour. That is, in other words, to lay the Foundations of that Empire which <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> was to Govern. This is the Noble Invention of our Author: But it has been Copyed by <U+017F>o many Sign-po<U+017F>t Daubers; that now 'tis grown ful<U+017F>om, rather by their want of Skill, than by the Commonne<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>In the la<U+017F>t place I may <U+017F>afely grant, that by reading <hi>Homer, Virgil</hi> was taught to imitate his Invention: That is, to imitate like him; which is no more, than if a Painter <U+017F>tudied <hi>Raphael,</hi> that he might learn to de<U+017F>ign after his manner. And thus I might imitate <hi>Virgil,</hi> if I were capable of writing an Heroick Poem, and yet the Invention be my own: But I <U+017F>hou'd endeavour to avoid a <U+017F>ervile Copying. I would not give the <U+017F>ame Story under other Names: With the <U+017F>ame Characters, in the <U+017F>ame Order, and with the <U+017F>ame Sequel: For every common Reader to find me out at the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight for a Plagiary: And cry, this I read before in <hi>Virgil,</hi> in a better Language, and in better Ver<U+017F>e: This is like merry <hi>Andrew</hi> on the low Rope, copying lubberly the <U+017F>ame Tricks, which his Ma<U+017F>ter is dextrou<U+017F>ly performing on the high.</p>
                  <p>I will trouble your Lord<U+017F>hip but with one Objection more; which I know not whether I found in <hi>Le Fevre</hi> or <hi>Valois,</hi> but I am <U+017F>ure I have read it in another <hi>French</hi> Critick, whom I will not name, becau<U+017F>e I think it is not much for his Reputation. <hi>Virgil,</hi> in the heat of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e for Example, in de<U+017F>cribing the fury of his Heroe in a Battel, when he is endeavouring to rai<U+017F>e our concernments to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<U+017F>t pitch, turns <U+017F>hort on the <U+017F>udden into <U+017F>ome <U+017F>imilitude, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, <U+017F>ay they, your attention from the main Subject, and mi<U+017F>pends it on <U+017F>ome trivial Image. He pours cold Water into the Caldron when his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s is to make it boil.</p>
                  <p>This Accu<U+017F>ation is general again<U+017F>t all who wou'd be thought Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Poets; but I think it touches <hi>Virgil</hi> le<U+017F>s than any. He is too great a Ma<U+017F>ter of his Art, to make a Blott which may <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily be hit. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, as I have <U+017F>aid, are not for Tragedy, which is all violent, and where the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions are in a perpetual ferment; for there they deaden where they <U+017F>hould animate; they are not of the nature of Dialogue, unle<U+017F>s in Comedy: A Metaphor is almo<U+017F>t all the Stage can <U+017F>uffer, which is a kind of Similitude comprehended in a word. But this Figure has a contrary effect in Heroick Poetry: There 'tis employ'd to rai<U+017F>e the Admiration, which is its proper bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. And Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not of <U+017F>o violent a nature as Fear or Hope, Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion or Horrour, or any Concernment we can have for <U+017F>uch or <U+017F>uch a Per<U+017F>on on the Stage. Not but I confe<U+017F>s, that Similitudes and De<U+017F>criptions, when drawn into an unrea<U+017F>onable length, mu<U+017F>t needs nau<U+017F>eate the Reader. Once I remember, and but once; <hi>Virgil</hi> makes a Similitude of fourteen Lines; and his de<U+017F>cription of Fame is about the <U+017F>ame number. He is blam'd for both; and I doubt not but he would have contracted them, had he liv'd to have review'd his Work: But Faults are no Precedents. This I have ob<U+017F>erv'd of his Similitudes in general, that they are not plac'd, as our unob<U+017F>erving Criticks tell us, in the heat of any Action: But commonly in its declining: When he has warm'd us in his De<U+017F>cription, as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly he can; then, le<U+017F>t that warmth <U+017F>hould langui<U+017F>h, he renews it by <U+017F>ome apt Similitude, which illu<U+017F>trates his Subject, and yet palls not his Audience. I need give your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip
<pb facs="tcp:43031:150"/>
but one Example of this kind, and leave the re<U+017F>t to your Ob<U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, when next you review the whole <hi>Aeneis</hi> in the Original un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemi<U+017F>h'd by my rude Tran<U+017F>lation. 'Tis in the fir<U+017F>t Book, where the Poet de<U+017F>cribes <hi>Neptune</hi> compo<U+017F>ing the Ocean, on which <hi>Eolus</hi> had rais'd a Tempe<U+017F>t, without his permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion. He had already chidden the Rebellious Winds for obeying the Commands of their U<U+017F>urping Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter: He had warn'd them from the Seas, He had beaten down the Billows with his Mace; di<U+017F>pell'd the Clouds, re<U+017F>tor'd the Sun-<U+017F>hine, while <hi>Triton</hi> and <hi>Cymothoe</hi> were heaving the Ships from off the Quick-Sands; before the Poet wou'd offer at a Similitude for illu<U+017F>tration.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>This is the fir<U+017F>t Similitude which <hi>Virgil</hi> makes in this Poem: And one of the longe<U+017F>t in the whole; for which Rea<U+017F>on I the rather cite it. While the Storm was in its fury, any Allu<U+017F>ion had been improper: For the Poet cou'd have compar'd it to nothing more impetuous than it <U+017F>elf; con<U+017F>equently he could have made no Illu<U+017F>tration. If he cou'd have illu<U+017F>trated, it had been an ambitious Ornament out of <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on, and would have diverted our Concernment: <hi>Nunc, non erat hi<U+017F>ce locus;</hi> and therefore he deferr'd it to its proper place.</p>
                  <p>The<U+017F>e are the Critici<U+017F>ms of mo<U+017F>t moment which have been made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> by the Ancients or Moderns. As for the particular Exceptions again<U+017F>t this or that pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, <hi>Macrobius</hi> and <hi>Pontanus</hi> have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>wer'd them already. If I de<U+017F>ir'd to appear more Learned than I am, it had been as ea<U+017F>ie for me to have taken their Objections and Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it is for a Country Par<U+017F>on to take the Expo<U+017F>itions of the Fathers out of <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius:</hi> Or not to have nam'd the Authors from whence I had them: For <U+017F>o <hi>Ruaeus,</hi> otherwi<U+017F>e a mo<U+017F>t judicious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator on <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Works, has us'd <hi>Pontanus,</hi> his greate<U+017F>t Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, of whom, he is very <U+017F>ilent, and I do not remember that he once cites him.</p>
                  <p>What follows next, is no Objection; for that implies a Fault: And it had been none in <hi>Virgil,</hi> if he had extended the time of his Action beyond a Year. At lea<U+017F>t <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> has <U+017F>et no preci<U+017F>e limits to it. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s, we know, was within two Months: <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o</hi> I am <U+017F>ure exceeds not a Summer: And if I examin'd him, perhaps he might be reduc'd into a much le<U+017F>s compa<U+017F>s. <hi>Bo<U+017F><U+017F>u</hi> leaves it doubtful whether <hi>Virgil</hi>'s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were within the Year, or took up <U+017F>ome Months beyond it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the whole Di<U+017F>pute is of no more concernment to the common Reader, than it is to a Plough-man, whether <hi>February</hi> this Year had 28 or 29 Days in it. But for the <U+017F>atisfaction of the more Curious, of which number, I am <U+017F>ure your Lord<U+017F>hip is one; I will Tran<U+017F>late what I think convenient out of <hi>Segrais,</hi> whom perhaps you have not read: For he has made it highly probable, that the Action of the <hi>Aeneis</hi> began in the Spring, and was not extended beyond the <hi>Autumn.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:43031:151"/>
And we have known Campaigns that have begun <U+017F>ooner, and have ended later.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi> and the re<U+017F>t whom <hi>Segrais</hi> names, who are of Opinion that the Action of this Poem takes up almo<U+017F>t a Year and half; ground their Calculation thus. <hi>Anchi<U+017F>es</hi> dyed in <hi>Sicily</hi> at the end of Winter, or beginning of the Spring. <hi>Aeneas,</hi> immediately after the Interment of his Father, puts to Sea for <hi>Italy:</hi> He is <U+017F>urpriz'd by the Tempe<U+017F>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>crib'd in the beginning of the fir<U+017F>t Book; and there it is that the Scene of the Poem opens; and where the Action mu<U+017F>t Commence. He is driven by this Storm on the Coa<U+017F>ts of <hi>Affrick:</hi> He <U+017F>tays at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> all that Summer, and almo<U+017F>t all the Winter following: Sets Sail again for <hi>Italy</hi> ju<U+017F>t before the beginning of the Spring; meets with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Winds, and makes <hi>Sicily</hi> the <U+017F>econd time: This part of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction compleats the Year. Then he celebrates the Aniver<U+017F>ary of his Father's Funerals, and <U+017F>hortly after arrives at <hi>Cumes,</hi> and from thence his time is taken up in his fir<U+017F>t Treaty with <hi>Latinus;</hi> the Overture of the War; the Siege of his Camp by <hi>Turnus;</hi> his going for Succours to relieve it: His return: The rai<U+017F>ing of the Siege by the fir<U+017F>t Battel: The twelve days Truce: The <U+017F>econd Battel: The A<U+017F><U+017F>ault of <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and the <U+017F>ingle Fight with <hi>Turnus;</hi> all which, they <U+017F>ay, cannot take up le<U+017F>s than four or five Months more; by which Account we cannot <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e the entire Action to be contain'd in a much le<U+017F>s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F>s than a Year and half.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Segrais</hi> reckons another way; and his computation is not condemn'd by the learned <hi>Ruaeus,</hi> who compil'd and Publi<U+017F>h'd the Commentaries on our Poet, which we call the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Virgil.</p>
                  <p>He allows the time of Year when <hi>Anchi<U+017F>es</hi> dyed; to be in the latter end of Winter, or the beginning of the Spring; he acknowledges that when <hi>Aeneas</hi> is fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>een at Sea afterwards, and is driven by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<U+017F>t on the Coa<U+017F>t of <hi>Affrick,</hi> is the time when the Action is naturally to begin: He confe<U+017F><U+017F>es farther, that <hi>Aeneas</hi> left <hi>Carthage</hi> in the latter end of Winter; for <hi>Dido</hi> tells him in expre<U+017F>s terms, as an Argument for his longer <U+017F>tay,
<q>Quinetiam Hyberno moliris <U+017F>ydere Cla<U+017F><U+017F>em.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whereas <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi>'s Followers <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e that when <hi>Aeneas</hi> had buried his Father, he <U+017F>et Sail immediately for <hi>Italy,</hi> (tho' the Tempe<U+017F>t drove him on the Coa<U+017F>t of <hi>Carthage.) Segrais</hi> will by no means allow that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition; but thinks it much more probable that he remain'd in <hi>Sicily</hi> 'till the mid<U+017F>t of <hi>July</hi> or the beginning of <hi>Augu<U+017F>t;</hi> at which time he places the fir<U+017F>t appearance of his Heroe on the Sea; and there opens the Action of the Poem. From which beginning, to the Death of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> which concludes the Action, there need not be <U+017F>uppos'd above ten Months of intermediate time: For arriving at <hi>Carthage</hi> in the latter end of Summer, <U+017F>taying there the Winter following; departing thence in the very beginning of the Spring; making a <U+017F>hort abode in <hi>Sicily</hi> the <U+017F>econd time, landing in <hi>Italy,</hi> and making the War, may be rea<U+017F>onably judg'd the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s but of three Months. To this the <hi>Ron<U+017F>ardians</hi> reply, that having been for Seven Years before in que<U+017F>t of <hi>Italy,</hi> and having no more to do in <hi>Sicily,</hi> than to interr his Father; after that Office was perform'd, what remain'd for him, but, without delay, to pur<U+017F>ue his fir<U+017F>t Adventure? To which <hi>Segrais</hi> an<U+017F>wers, that the Ob<U+017F>equies of his Father, according to the Rites of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:43031:151"/>
                     <hi>Romans,</hi> would detain him for many days: That a longer time mu<U+017F>t be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in the refitting of his Ships, after <U+017F>o tedious a Voyage; and in refre<U+017F>hing his Weather-beaten Souldiers on a friendly Coa<U+017F>t. The<U+017F>e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are but Suppo<U+017F>itions on both <U+017F>ides, yet tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Segrais</hi> <U+017F>eem bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounded. For the Fea<U+017F>t of <hi>Dido,</hi> when <U+017F>he entertain'd <hi>Aeneas</hi> fir<U+017F>t, has the appearance of a Summer's Night, which <U+017F>eems already almo<U+017F>t ended, when he begins his Story: Therefore the Love was made in Autumn; the Hunting follow'd properly when the Heats of that <U+017F>corching Country were declining: The Winter was pa<U+017F>s'd in jollity, as the Sea<U+017F>on and their Love requir'd; and he left her in the latter end of Winter, as is already prov'd. This Opinion is fortify'd by the Arrival of <hi>Aeneas</hi> at the Mouth of <hi>Tyber;</hi> which marks the Sea<U+017F>on of the Spring, that Sea<U+017F>on being perfectly de<U+017F>crib'd by the <U+017F>inging of the Birds, <U+017F>aluting the dawn; and by the Beauty of the place, which the Poet <U+017F>eems to have painted expre<U+017F>ly in the Seventh <hi>Aeneid.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The remainder of the Action requir'd but three Months more; for when <hi>Aeneas</hi> went for Succour to the <hi>Tu<U+017F>cans,</hi> he found their Army in a readine<U+017F>s to march; and wanting only a Commander: So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Calculation, the <hi>Aeneis</hi> takes not up above a Year com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and may be comprehended in le<U+017F>s compa<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>This, among<U+017F>t other Circum<U+017F>tances, treated more at large by <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grais,</hi> agrees with the ri<U+017F>ing of <hi>Orion,</hi> which caus'd the Tempe<U+017F>t, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>crib'd in the beginning of the fir<U+017F>t Book.

The <hi>Heliacal</hi> ri<U+017F>ing of a Con<U+017F>tellation, is when it comes from under the Rays of the Sun, and begins to appear before Day-light.

                  <p>The <hi>Heliacal</hi> ri<U+017F>ing of <hi>Orion,</hi> is at pre<U+017F>ent computed to be about the <U+017F>ixth of <hi>July;</hi> and about that time it is, that he either cau<U+017F>es, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ages Tempe<U+017F>ts on the Seas.</p>

I have yet a word or two to <U+017F>ay of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Machines, from my own ob<U+017F>ervation of them. He has imitated tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Homer,</hi> but not Copied them. It was e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h'd long before this time, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion as well as in the <hi>Greek;</hi> that there were Gods; and both Nations, for the mo<U+017F>t part, wor<U+017F>hipp'd the <U+017F>ame Deities; as did al<U+017F>o the <hi>Trojans:</hi> From whom the <hi>Romans,</hi> I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, wou'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be thought to derive the Rites of their Religion, than from the <hi>Grecians;</hi> becau<U+017F>e they thought them<U+017F>elves de<U+017F>cended from them. Each of tho<U+017F>e Gods had his proper Office, and the chief of them their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Attendants. Thus <hi>Jupiter</hi> had in propriety, <hi>Ganimede</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> had <hi>Iris.</hi> It was not then for <hi>Virgil</hi> to create new Mini<U+017F>ters; he mu<U+017F>t take what he found in his Religion. It cannot therefore be <U+017F>aid that he borrow'd them from <hi>Homer,</hi> any more than <hi>Apollo, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t, whom he u<U+017F>es as he finds occa<U+017F>ion for them, as the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poet did: But he invents the occa<U+017F>ions for which he u<U+017F>es them. <hi>Venus,</hi> after the de<U+017F>truction of <hi>Troy,</hi> had gain'd <hi>Neptune</hi> entirely to her Party; therefore we find him bu<U+017F>ie in the beginning of the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> to calm the Tempe<U+017F>t rais'd by <hi>Aeolus,</hi> and afterwards conducting the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> Fleet to <hi>Cumes</hi> in <U+017F>afety, with the lo<U+017F>s only of their Pilot; for whom he Bargains. I name tho<U+017F>e two Examples among<U+017F>t a hundred which I omit; to prove that <hi>Virgil,</hi> generally <U+017F>peaking, employ'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines in performing tho<U+017F>e things, which might po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly have been done without them. What more frequent then a Storm at Sea, upon the ri<U+017F>ing of <hi>Orion?</hi> What wonder, if among<U+017F>t <U+017F>o many Ships there <U+017F>hou'd one be over<U+017F>et, which was commanded by <hi>Orontes;</hi> though half the Winds had not been there, which <hi>Aeolus</hi> employ'd? Might not <hi>Palinurus,</hi> without a Miracle, fall a<U+017F>leep, and drop into the Sea, having been over-wearied with watching, and <U+017F>ecure of a quiet pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, by his ob<U+017F>ervation of the Skies? At lea<U+017F>t <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who knew nothing of the Machine of <hi>Somnus,</hi> takes it plainly in this Sen<U+017F>e.</p>

                  <p>But Machines <U+017F>ometimes are <U+017F>pecious things to amu<U+017F>e the Reader, and give a colour of probability to things otherwi<U+017F>e incredible. And be<U+017F>ides, it <U+017F>ooth'd the vanity of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to find the Gods <U+017F>o vi<U+017F>ibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in all the Actions of their Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors. We who are better taught by our Religion, yet own every wonderful Accident which befalls us for the be<U+017F>t, to be brought to pa<U+017F>s by <U+017F>ome <U+017F>pecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Almighty God; and by the care of guardian Angels: And from hence I might infer, that no Heroick Poem can be writ on the <hi>Epicuraean</hi> Principles. Which I cou'd ea<U+017F>ily demon<U+017F>trate, if there were need to prove it, or I had lei<U+017F>ure.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Venus</hi> opens the Eyes of her Son <hi>Aeneas,</hi> to behold the Gods who Combated again<U+017F>t <hi>Troy,</hi> in that fatal Night when it was <U+017F>urpriz'd; we <U+017F>hare the plea<U+017F>ure of that glorious Vi<U+017F>ion, (which <hi>Ta<U+017F><U+017F>o</hi> has not ill Copied in the <U+017F>acking of <hi>Jeru<U+017F>alem.)</hi> But the <hi>Greeks</hi> had done their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s; though neither <hi>Neptune, Juno,</hi> or <hi>Pallas,</hi> had given them their Divine a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance. The mo<U+017F>t crude Machine which <hi>Virgil</hi> u<U+017F>es, is in
<pb facs="tcp:43031:152"/>
the <hi>Epi<U+017F>ode</hi> of <hi>Camilla,</hi> where <hi>Opis</hi> by the command of her Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, kills <hi>Aruns.</hi> The next is in the Twelfth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> where <hi>Venus</hi> cures her Son <hi>Aeneas.</hi> But in the la<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e, the Poet was driven to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ity; for <hi>Turnus</hi> was to be <U+017F>lain that very day: And <hi>Aeneas,</hi> wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he was, cou'd not have Engag'd him in <U+017F>ingle Combat, unle<U+017F>s his Hurt had been miraculou<U+017F>ly heal'd. And the Poet had con<U+017F>ider'd that the <hi>Dittany</hi> which <U+017F>he brought from <hi>Crete,</hi> cou'd not have wrought <U+017F>o <U+017F>peedy an effect, without the Juice of <hi>Ambro<U+017F>ia,</hi> which <U+017F>he mingled with it. After all, that his Machine might not <U+017F>eem too violent, we <U+017F>ee the Heroe limping after <hi>Turnus.</hi> The Wound was skin'd; but the <U+017F>trength of his Thigh was not re<U+017F>tor'd. But what Rea<U+017F>on had our Author to wound <hi>Aeneas</hi> at <U+017F>o critical a time? And how came the Cui<U+017F><U+017F>es to be wor<U+017F>e temper'd than the re<U+017F>t of his Armour, which was all wrought by <hi>Vulcan</hi> and his Journey-men? The<U+017F>e difficulties are not ea<U+017F>ily to be <U+017F>olv'd, without confe<U+017F><U+017F>ing that <hi>Virgil</hi> had not life enough to correct his Work: Tho' he had review'd it, and found tho<U+017F>e Errours which he re<U+017F>olv'd to mend: But being prevented by Death, and not willing to leave an imperfect work behind him, he ordain'd, by his la<U+017F>t Te<U+017F>tament, that his <hi>Aeneis</hi> <U+017F>hould be burn'd. As for the death of <hi>Aruns,</hi> who was <U+017F>hot by a Godde<U+017F>s, the Machine was not altogether <U+017F>o outragious, as the wounding <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> by the Sword of <hi>Diomede.</hi> Two Divinities, one wou'd have thought, might have pleaded their Prerogative of Impa<U+017F><U+017F>ibility, or, at lea<U+017F>t not to have been wounded by any mortal Hand. Be<U+017F>ide that the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> which they <U+017F>hed, was <U+017F>o very like our common Blood, that it was not to be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd from it, but only by the Name and Colour. As for what <hi>Horate</hi> <U+017F>ays in his Art of Poetry; that no Machines are to be us'd, unle<U+017F>s on <U+017F>ome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occa<U+017F>ion,
<q>Nec Deus inter<U+017F>it, ni<U+017F>i dignus vindice nodus.</q>
That Rule is to be apply'd to the Theatre, of which he is then <U+017F>peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and means no more than this, that when the Knot of the Play is to be unty'd, and no other way is left, for making the di<U+017F>covery; then and not otherwi<U+017F>e, let a God de<U+017F>cend upon a Rope, and clear the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to the Audience: But this has no relation to the Machines which are us'd in an Epick Poem.</p>
                  <p>In the la<U+017F>t place, for the <hi>Dira,</hi> or Flying-Pe<U+017F>t, which flapping on the Shield of <hi>Turnus,</hi> and fluttering about his Head, di<U+017F>hearten'd him in the Duel, and pre<U+017F>ag'd to him his approaching Death, I might have plac'd it more properly among<U+017F>t the Objections. For the Criticks, who lay want of Courage to the Charge of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Heroe; quote this Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age as a main proof of their A<U+017F><U+017F>ertion. They <U+017F>ay our Author had not only <U+017F>ecur'd him before the Duel, but al<U+017F>o in the beginning of it, had given him the advantage in impenetrable Arms, and in his Sword: (for that of <hi>Turnus</hi> was not his own, which was forg'd by <hi>Vulcan</hi> for his Father) but a Weapon which he had <U+017F>natch'd in ha<U+017F>te, and by mi<U+017F>take, belonging to his Charioteer <hi>Meti<U+017F>cus.</hi> That after all this, <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who was partial to the <hi>Trojan,</hi> and di<U+017F>tru<U+017F>tful of the Event, though he had hung the Ballance, and given it a jog of his hand to weigh down <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> thought convenient to give the Fates a collatteral Security, by <U+017F>ending the Screech-Owl to di<U+017F>courage him. For which they quote the<U+017F>e words of <hi>Virgil.</hi>

Nothing can be more Beautiful, or more Poetical than his de<U+017F>cription of the three <hi>Dirae,</hi> or the <U+017F>etting of the Balance, which our <hi>Milton</hi> has bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd from him, but employ'd to a different end: For fir<U+017F>t he makes God Almighty <U+017F>et the Scales for St. <hi>Michael</hi> and <hi>Sathan,</hi> when he knew no Combat was to follow; then he makes the good Angel's Scale de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cend, and the Devils mount; quite contrary to <hi>Virgil,</hi> if I have Tran<U+017F>lated the three Ver<U+017F>es, according to my Author's Sen<U+017F>e.

                  <p>For I have taken the<U+017F>e words <hi>Quem damnet labor,</hi> in the Sen<U+017F>e which <hi>Virgil</hi> gives them in another place; <hi>Damnabis tu quoque votis;</hi> to <U+017F>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a pro<U+017F>perous Event. Yet I dare not condemn <U+017F>o great a Genius as <hi>Milton:</hi> For I am much mi<U+017F>taken if he alludes not to the Text in <hi>Daniel,</hi> where <hi>Bel<U+017F>hazzar</hi> was put into the Balance, and found too light: This is digre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, and I return to my Subject. I <U+017F>aid above, that the<U+017F>e two Machines of the Balance, and the <hi>Dira,</hi> were only Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, and that the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s of the Duel had been the <U+017F>ame without them. For when <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Turnus</hi> <U+017F>tood fronting each other before the Altar, <hi>Turnus</hi> look'd dejected, and his Colour faded in his Face, as if he de<U+017F>ponded of the Victory before the Fight; and not only he, but all his Party, when the <U+017F>trength of the two Champions was judg'd by the proportion of their Limbs, concluded it was <hi>impar pugna,</hi> and that their Chief was over-match'd: Whereupon <hi>Juturna</hi> (who was of the <U+017F>ame Opinion) took his opportunity to break the Treaty and renew the War. <hi>Juno</hi> her <U+017F>elf had plainly told the Nymph beforehand, that her Brother was to Fight
<q>Imparibus fatis; nec Diis, nec viribus aequis;</q>
So that there was no need of an Apparition to fright <hi>Turnus.</hi> He had the pre<U+017F>age within him<U+017F>elf of his impending De<U+017F>tiny. The <hi>Dirae</hi> only <U+017F>erv'd to confirm him in his fir<U+017F>t Opinion, that it was his De<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to die in the en<U+017F>uing Combat. And in this <U+017F>en<U+017F>e are tho<U+017F>e words of <hi>Virgil</hi> to be taken.

no purpo<U+017F>e. How cou'd he fa<U+017F>ten a blow, or make a thru<U+017F>t, when he was not <U+017F>uffer'd to approach? Be<U+017F>ides, the chief Errand of the <hi>Dira,</hi> was to warn <hi>Juturna</hi> from the Field, for <U+017F>he cou'd have brought the Chariot again, when <U+017F>he <U+017F>aw her Brother wor<U+017F>ted in the Duel. I might farther add, that <hi>Aeneas</hi> was <U+017F>o eager of the Fight, that he left the City, now almo<U+017F>t in his Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion, to decide his quarrel with <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> by the Sword: Whereas <hi>Turnus</hi> had manife<U+017F>tly declin'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and <U+017F>uffer'd his Si<U+017F>ter to convey him as far from the reach of his Enemy as <U+017F>he cou'd.

                  <p>I have dwelt <U+017F>o long on this Subject, that I mu<U+017F>t contract what I have to <U+017F>ay, in reference to my Tran<U+017F>lation: Unle<U+017F>s I wou'd <U+017F>well my Preface into a Volume, and make it formidable to your Lord<U+017F>hip, when you <U+017F>ee <U+017F>o many Pages yet behind. And indeed what I have already written either in ju<U+017F>tification or prai<U+017F>e of <hi>Virgil,</hi> is again<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf; for pre<U+017F>uming to Copy, in my cour<U+017F>e Engli<U+017F>h, the Thoughts and Beautiful Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of this inimitable Poet: Who flouri<U+017F>h'd in an Age when his Language was brought to its la<U+017F>t perfection, for which it was particularly owing to him and <hi>Horace.</hi> I will give your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>hip my Opinion, that tho<U+017F>e two Friends had con<U+017F>ulted each others Judgment, wherein they <U+017F>hould endeavour to excel; and they <U+017F>eem to have pitch'd on Propriety of Thought, Elegance of Words, and Harmony of Numbers. According to this Model, <hi>Horace</hi> writ his <hi>Odes</hi> and <hi>Epods:</hi> For his <hi>Satires</hi> and <hi>Epi<U+017F>tles,</hi> being intended wholly for in<U+017F>truction, requir'd another Style:
<q>Ornari res ip<U+017F>a negat, contenta doceri:</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore as he him<U+017F>elf profe<U+017F><U+017F>es, are <hi>Sermoni propiora,</hi> nearer Pro<U+017F>e than Ver<U+017F>e. But <hi>Virgil,</hi> who never attempted the Lyrick Ver<U+017F>e, is every where Elegant, <U+017F>weet and flowing in his <hi>Hexameters.</hi> His words are not only cho<U+017F>en, but the places in which he ranks them for the <U+017F>ound; he who removes them from the Station wherein their Ma<U+017F>ter <U+017F>ets them, <U+017F>poils the Harmony. What he <U+017F>ays of the <hi>Sybill</hi>'s Prophecies, may be as properly apply'd to every word of his: They mu<U+017F>t be read, in order as they lie; the lea<U+017F>t breath di<U+017F>compo<U+017F>es them, and <U+017F>omewhat of their Divinity is lo<U+017F>t. I cannot boa<U+017F>t that I have been thus exact in my Ver<U+017F>es, but I have endeavour'd to follow the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of my Ma<U+017F>ter: And am the fir<U+017F>t <hi>Engli<U+017F>hman,</hi> perhaps, who made it his de<U+017F>ign to copy him in his Numbers, his choice of Words, and his placing them for the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of the <U+017F>ound. On this la<U+017F>t Con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I have <U+017F>hun'd the <hi>Cae<U+017F>ura</hi> as much as po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly I cou'd. For wherever that is us'd, it gives a roughne<U+017F>s to the Ver<U+017F>e, of which we can have little need, in a Language which is over-<U+017F>tock'd with Con<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. Such is not the Latine, where the Vowels and Con<U+017F>onants are mix'd in proportion to each other: yet <hi>Virgil</hi> judg'd the Vowels to have <U+017F>omewhat of an over-balance, and therefore tempers their <U+017F>weet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s with <hi>Cae<U+017F>uras.</hi> Such difference there is in Tongues, that the <U+017F>ame Figure which roughens one, gives Maje<U+017F>ty to another: and that
<pb facs="tcp:43031:154"/>
was it which <hi>Virgil</hi> <U+017F>tudied in his Ver<U+017F>es. <hi>Ovid</hi> u<U+017F>es it but rarely; and hence it is that his Ver<U+017F>ification cannot <U+017F>o properly be call'd <U+017F>weet, as lu<U+017F>cious. The <hi>Italians</hi> are forc'd upon it, once or twice in every line, becau<U+017F>e they have a redundancy of Vowels in their Language. Their Metal is <U+017F>o <U+017F>oft, that it will not Coyn without Alloy to harden it. On the other <U+017F>ide, for the Rea<U+017F>on already nam'd, 'tis all we can do to give <U+017F>ufficient <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s to our Language: We mu<U+017F>t not only chu<U+017F>e our words for Elegance, but for <U+017F>ound. To perform which, a Ma<U+017F>tery in the Language is requir'd; the Poet mu<U+017F>t have a Magazine of Words, and have the Art to mannage his few Vowels to the be<U+017F>t advantage, that they may go the farther. He mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o know the nature of the Vowels, which are more <U+017F>onorous, and which more <U+017F>oft and <U+017F>weet; and <U+017F>o di<U+017F>po<U+017F>e them as his pre<U+017F>ent occa<U+017F>ions require: All which, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>and <U+017F>ecrets of Ver<U+017F>ification be<U+017F>ide, he may learn from <hi>Virgil,</hi> if he will take him for his Guide. If he be above <hi>Virgil,</hi> and is re<U+017F>olv'd to follow his own <hi>Verve</hi> (as the <hi>French</hi> call it,) the Proverb will fall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily upon him; <hi>Who teaches him<U+017F>elf, has a Fool for his Ma<U+017F>ter.</hi>

                     <hi>Virgil</hi> employ'd Eleven Years upon his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> yet he left it as he thought him<U+017F>elf imperfect. Which when I <U+017F>eriou<U+017F>ly con<U+017F>ider, I wi<U+017F>h, that in<U+017F>tead of three years which I have <U+017F>pent in the Tran<U+017F>lation of his Works, I had four years more allow'd me to correct my Errours, that I might make my Ver<U+017F>ion <U+017F>omewhat more tolerable than it is. For a Poet cannot have too great a reverence for his Readers, if he expects his Labours <U+017F>hou'd <U+017F>urvive him. Yet I will neither plead my Age nor Sickne<U+017F>s in excu<U+017F>e of the faults which I have made: That I wanted time is all I have to <U+017F>ay. For <U+017F>ome of my Sub<U+017F>cribers grew <U+017F>o clamorous, that I cou'd no longer deferr the Publication. I hope from the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of your Lord<U+017F>hip, and your often experienc'd goodne<U+017F>s to me, that if the faults are not too many, you will make allowances with <hi>Horace.</hi>

                  <p>You may plea<U+017F>e al<U+017F>o to ob<U+017F>erve, that there is not, to the be<U+017F>t of my remembrance, one Vowel gaping on another for want of a <hi>Cae<U+017F>ura,</hi> in this whole Poem. But where a Vowel ends a word, the next begins either with a Con<U+017F>onant, or what is its equivalent; for our <hi>W</hi> and <hi>H</hi> a<U+017F>pirate, and our Dipthongues are plainly <U+017F>uch: The greate<U+017F>t lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude I take, is in the Letter <hi>Y,</hi> when it concludes a word, and the fir<U+017F>t Syllable of the next begins with a Vowel. Neither need I have call'd this a latitude, which is only an explanation of this general Rule. That no Vowel can be cut off before another, when we cannot <U+017F>ink the Pronunciation of it: As <hi>He, She, Me, I,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Virgil</hi> thinks it <U+017F>ometimes a Beauty, to imitate the Licen<U+017F>e of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and leave two Vowels opening on each other, as in that Ver<U+017F>e of the Third Pa<U+017F>toral,
<q>Et <U+017F>uccus pecori &amp; lac <U+017F>ubducitur Agnis.</q>

<pb facs="tcp:43031:154"/>
I have treated with <U+017F>ome exactne<U+017F>s of the Feet, the Quantities, and the Pau<U+017F>es. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> know nothing of the two fir<U+017F>t; at lea<U+017F>t their be<U+017F>t Poets have not practis'd them. As for the Pau<U+017F>es, <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herb</hi> fir<U+017F>t brought them into <hi>France,</hi> within this la<U+017F>t Century: And we <U+017F>ee how they adorn their <hi>Alexandrins.</hi> But as <hi>Virgil</hi> propounds a Riddle which he leaves un<U+017F>olv'd:
<q>
                        <l>Dic quibus in terris, in<U+017F>cripti nomina Regum</l>
                        <l>Na<U+017F>cantur flores, &amp; Phyllida <U+017F>olus habeto.</l>
                     </q>
So I will give your Lord<U+017F>hip another, and leave the Expo<U+017F>ition of it to your acute Judgment. I am <U+017F>ure there are few who make Ver<U+017F>es, have ob<U+017F>erv'd the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of the<U+017F>e two Lines in <hi>Coopers Hill.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Tho' deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull;</l>

                     </q>
And there are yet fewer who can find the Rea<U+017F>on of that <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s. I have given it to <U+017F>ome of my Friends in Conver<U+017F>ation, and they have allow'd the Critici<U+017F>m to be ju<U+017F>t. But <U+017F>ince the evil of fal<U+017F>e quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities is difficult to be cur'd in any Modern Language; <U+017F>ince the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Italians</hi> as well as we, are yet ignorant what feet are to be us'd in Heroick Poetry; <U+017F>ince I have not <U+017F>trictly ob<U+017F>erv'd tho<U+017F>e Rules my <U+017F>elf, which I can teach others; <U+017F>ince I pretend to no Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor<U+017F>hip among my Fellow-Poets; <U+017F>ince if I <U+017F>hou'd in<U+017F>truct <U+017F>ome of them to make well-running Ver<U+017F>es, they want Genius to give them <U+017F>trength as well as <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s; and above all, <U+017F>ince your Lord<U+017F>hip has advis'd me not to publi<U+017F>h that little which I know, I look on your Coun<U+017F>el as your Command, which I <U+017F>hall ob<U+017F>erve inviolably, 'till you <U+017F>hall plea<U+017F>e to revoke it, and leave me at liberty to make my thoughts publick. In the mean time, that I may arrogate nothing to my <U+017F>elf, I mu<U+017F>t acknowledge that <hi>Virgil</hi> in Latine, and <hi>Spencer</hi> in Engli<U+017F>h, have been my Ma<U+017F>ters. <hi>Spencer</hi> has al<U+017F>o given me the boldne<U+017F>s to make u<U+017F>e <U+017F>ometimes of his <hi>Alexandrin</hi> Line, which we call, though improperly, the <hi>Pindarick;</hi> becau<U+017F>e Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> has often employ'd it in his <hi>Odes.</hi> It adds a certain Maje<U+017F>ty to the Ver<U+017F>e, when 'tis us'd with Judgment, and <U+017F>tops the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e from overflowing into another Line. Formerly the <hi>French,</hi> like us, and the <hi>Italians,</hi> had but five Feet, or ten Syllables in their Heroick Ver<U+017F>e: but <U+017F>ince <hi>Ron<U+017F>ard</hi>'s time, as I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, they found their Tongue too weak to <U+017F>upport their Epick Poetry, without the addition of another Foot. That indeed has given it <U+017F>omewhat of the run, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure of a <hi>Trimeter;</hi> but it runs with more activity than <U+017F>trength: Their Language is not <U+017F>trung with Sinews like our Engli<U+017F>h. It has the nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of a Greyhound, but not the bulk and body of a Ma<U+017F>tiff. Our Men and our Ver<U+017F>es over-bear them by their weight; and <hi>Pondere non Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero,</hi> is the <hi>Briti<U+017F>h</hi> Motto. The <hi>French</hi> have <U+017F>et up Purity for the Standard of their Language; and a Ma<U+017F>culine Vigour is that of ours. Like their Tongue is the Genius of their Poets, light and trifling in compari<U+017F>on of the Engli<U+017F>h; more proper for Sonnets, Madrigals, and Elegies, than Heroick Poetry. The turn on Thoughts and Words is their chief Talent, but the Epick Poem is too <U+017F>tately to receive tho<U+017F>e little Ornaments. The Painters draw their Nymphs in thin and airy Habits, but the weight of Gold and of Embroideries is re<U+017F>erv'd for Queens
<pb facs="tcp:43031:155"/>
and Godde<U+017F><U+017F>es. <hi>Virgil</hi> is never frequent in tho<U+017F>e Turns, like <hi>Ovid,</hi> but much more <U+017F>paring of them in his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> than in his <hi>Pa<U+017F>torals</hi> and <hi>Georgicks.</hi>

The Poet found it before his Criticks, but it was a darling Sin which he wou'd not be per<U+017F>waded to reform. The want of Genius, of which I have accus'd the <hi>French,</hi> is laid to their Charge by one of their own great Authors, though I have forgotten his Name, and where I read it. If Rewards cou'd make good Poets, their great Ma<U+017F>ter has not been wanting on his part in his bountiful Encouragements: For he is wi<U+017F>e enough to imitate <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> if he had a <hi>Maro.</hi> The <hi>Triumvir</hi> and <hi>Pro<U+017F>criber</hi> had de<U+017F>cended to us in a more hideous form than they now appear, if the Emperour had not taken care to make Friends of him and <hi>Horace.</hi> I confe<U+017F>s the Bani<U+017F>hment of <hi>Ovid</hi> was a Blot in his E<U+017F>cutcheon, yet he was only Bani<U+017F>h'd, and who knows but his Crime was Capital, and then his Exile was a Favour? <hi>Ario<U+017F>to,</hi> who with all his faults, mu<U+017F>t be acknowledg'd a great Poet, has put the<U+017F>e words into the mouth of an Evangeli<U+017F>t, but whether they will pa<U+017F>s for Go<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel now, I cannot tell.</p>

                  <p>But Heroick Poetry is not of the growth of <hi>France,</hi> as it might be of <hi>England,</hi> if it were Cultivated. <hi>Spencer</hi> wanted only to have read the Rules of <hi>Bo<U+017F><U+017F>u:</hi> for no Man was ever Born with a greater Genius, or had more Knowledge to <U+017F>upport it. But the performance of the <hi>French</hi> is not equal to their Skill; and hitherto we have wanted Skill to perform better. <hi>Segrais,</hi> who<U+017F>e Preface is <U+017F>o wonderfully good, yet is wholly de<U+017F>titute of Elevation; though his Ver<U+017F>ion is much better than that of the two Brothers, or any of the re<U+017F>t who have attempted <hi>Virgil. Hannibal Caro</hi> is a great Name among<U+017F>t the <hi>Italians,</hi> yet his Tran<U+017F>lation of the <hi>Aeneis</hi> is mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>candalou<U+017F>ly mean, though he has taken the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of writing in Blank Ver<U+017F>e, and freed him<U+017F>elf from the <U+017F>hackles of modern Rhime: (if it be modern, for <hi>Le Clerc</hi> has told us lately, and I believe has made it out, that <hi>David</hi>'s P<U+017F>alms were written in as errant Rhime as they are Tran<U+017F>lated.) Now if a Mu<U+017F>e cannot run when <U+017F>he is unfetter'd, 'tis a <U+017F>ign <U+017F>he has but little <U+017F>peed. I will not make a digre<U+017F><U+017F>ion here, though I am <U+017F>trangely tempted to it; but will only <U+017F>ay, that he who can write well in Rhime, may write better in Blank Ver<U+017F>e. Rhime is certainly a con<U+017F>traint even to the be<U+017F>t Poets, and tho<U+017F>e who make it with mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>e; though perhaps I have as little rea<U+017F>on to complain of that hard<U+017F>hip as any Man, excepting

                     <hi>Quarles,</hi> and <hi>Withers.</hi> What it adds to <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s, it takes away from <U+017F>en<U+017F>e; and he who lo<U+017F>es the lea<U+017F>t by it, may be call'd a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: it often makes us <U+017F>werve from an Author's meaning. As if a Mark be <U+017F>et up for an Archer at a great di<U+017F>tance, let him aim as exactly as he can, the lea<U+017F>t wind will take his Arrow, and divert it from the White. I return to our <hi>Italian</hi> Tran<U+017F>latour of the <hi>Aeneis:</hi> He is a Foot-Poet, he Lacquies by the <U+017F>ide of <hi>Virgil</hi> at the be<U+017F>t, but never mounts behind him. Doctor <hi>Morelli,</hi> who is no mean Critick in our Poetry, and therefore may be pre<U+017F>um'd to be a better in his own Language, has confirm'd me in this Opinion by his Judgment, and thinks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that he has often mi<U+017F>taken his Ma<U+017F>ter's Sen<U+017F>e. I wou'd <U+017F>ay <U+017F>o, if I dur<U+017F>t, but I am afraid I have committed the <U+017F>ame fault more often, and more gro<U+017F>ly: For I have for<U+017F>aken <hi>Ruaeus,</hi> (whom generally I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) in many places, and made Expo<U+017F>itions of my own in <U+017F>ome, quite contrary to him. Of which I will give but two Examples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e they are <U+017F>o near each other in the Tenth <hi>Aeneid.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>—Sorti Pater aequus utrique.</hi>

                     <hi>Pallas</hi> <U+017F>ays it to <hi>Turnus</hi> ju<U+017F>t before they Fight. <hi>Ruaeus</hi> thinks that the word <hi>Pater</hi> is to be referr'd to <hi>Evander</hi> the Father of <hi>Pallas.</hi> But how cou'd he imagine that it was the <U+017F>ame thing to <hi>Evander,</hi> if his Son were <U+017F>lain, or if he overcame. The Poet certainly intended <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> the common Father of Mankind; who, as <hi>Pallas</hi> hop'd, wou'd <U+017F>tand an impartial Spectatour of the Combat, and not be more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>Turnus,</hi> than to him. The Second is not long after it, and both before the Duel is begun. They are the words of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who comforts <hi>Hercules</hi> for the death of <hi>Pallas,</hi> which was immediately to en<U+017F>ue, and which <hi>Hercules</hi> cou'd not hinder (though the young Heroe had addre<U+017F>s'd his Prayers to him for his a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance:) Becau<U+017F>e the Gods cannot controul De<U+017F>tiny—the Ver<U+017F>e follows.

inferiour to them, and <U+017F>ome others of the Living. But 'tis one thing to take pains on a Fragment, and Tran<U+017F>late it perfectly; and another thing to have the weight of a whole Author on my <U+017F>houlders. They who believe the burthen light, let them attempt the Fourth, Sixth or Eighth <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral,</hi> the Fir<U+017F>t or Fourth <hi>Georgick;</hi> and among<U+017F>t the <hi>Aeneids,</hi> the Fourth, the Fifth, the Seventh, the Ninth, the Tenth, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, or the Twelfth; for in the<U+017F>e I think I have <U+017F>ucceeded be<U+017F>t.</p>
                  <p>Long before I undertook this Work, I was no <U+017F>tranger to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. I had al<U+017F>o <U+017F>tudied <hi>Virgil</hi>'s De<U+017F>ign, his di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of it, his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, his judicious management of the Figures, the <U+017F>ober retrenchments of his Sen<U+017F>e, which always leaves <U+017F>omewhat to gratifie our imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on which it may enlarge at plea<U+017F>ure; but above all, the Elegance of his Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ions, and the harmony of his Numbers. For, as I have <U+017F>aid in a former Di<U+017F><U+017F>ertation, the words are in Poetry, what the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are in Painting. If the De<U+017F>ign be good, and the Draught be true, the Colouring is the fir<U+017F>t Beauty that <U+017F>trikes the Eye. <hi>Spencer</hi> and <hi>Milton</hi> are the neare<U+017F>t in Engli<U+017F>h to <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> in the Latine; and have endeavour'd to form my Stile by imitating their Ma<U+017F>ters. I will farther own to you, my Lord, that my chief Ambition is to plea<U+017F>e tho<U+017F>e Readers, who have di<U+017F>cernment enough to prefer <hi>Virgil</hi> before any other Poet in the Latine Tongue. Such Spirits as he de<U+017F>ir'd to plea<U+017F>e, <U+017F>uch wou'd I chu<U+017F>e for my Judges, and wou'd <U+017F>tand or fall by them alone. <hi>Segrais</hi> has di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd the Readers of Poetry, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their capacity of judging, into three Cla<U+017F><U+017F>es: (He might have <U+017F>aid the <U+017F>ame of Writers too if he had pleas'd.) In the lowe<U+017F>t Form he places tho<U+017F>e whom he calls <hi>Les Petits E<U+017F>prits:</hi> <U+017F>uch things as are our Upper-Gallery Audience in a Play-Hou<U+017F>e; who like nothing but the Husk and Rhind of Wit; preferr a Quibble, a Conceit, an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram, before <U+017F>olid Sen<U+017F>e, and Elegant Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion: The<U+017F>e are Mobb-Readers: If <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Martial</hi> <U+017F>tood for Parliament-Men, we know already who wou'd carry it. But though they make the greate<U+017F>t ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the Field, and cry the loude<U+017F>t, the be<U+017F>t on't is, they are but a <U+017F>ort of <hi>French Hugonots,</hi> or <hi>Dutch Boors,</hi> brought over in Herds, but not Naturaliz'd: who have not Land of two Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<U+017F><U+017F>us,</hi> and therefore are not priviledg'd to Poll. Their Authors are of the <U+017F>ame level; fit to repre<U+017F>ent them on a Mountebank's-Stage, or to be Ma<U+017F>ters of the Ceremonies in a Bear-Garden. Yet the<U+017F>e are they who have the mo<U+017F>t Admirers. But it often happens, to their mortification, that as their Readers improve their Stock of Sen<U+017F>e, (as they may by reading better Books, and by Conver<U+017F>ation with Men of Judgment,) they <U+017F>oon for<U+017F>ake them: And when the Torrent from the Mountains falls no more, the <U+017F>welling Writer is reduc'd into his <U+017F>hallow Bed, like the <hi>Mançanares</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> with <U+017F>carce water to moi<U+017F>ten his own Pebbles. There are a middle <U+017F>ort of Readers (as we hold there is a middle <U+017F>tate of Souls) <U+017F>uch as have a farther in<U+017F>ight than the former; yet have not the capacity of judging right; (for I <U+017F>peak not of tho<U+017F>e who are brib'd by a Party, and know better if they were not corrupted;) but I mean a Company of warm young Men, who are not yet arriv'd <U+017F>o far as to di<U+017F>cern the difference betwixt Fu<U+017F>tian, or o<U+017F>tentatious Sentences, and the true <U+017F>ublime. The<U+017F>e are above liking <hi>Martial,</hi> or <hi>Owen</hi>'s Epigrams, but they wou'd certainly <U+017F>et <hi>Virgil</hi> below <hi>Statius,</hi> or <hi>Lucan.</hi> I need not <U+017F>ay their Poets are of the <U+017F>ame Pa<U+017F>te with their Admirers. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect greatne<U+017F>s in all they write, but 'tis a bladder'd greatne<U+017F>s, like that of the vain Man whom <hi>Seneca</hi> de<U+017F>cribes: An ill habit of Body, full of
<pb facs="tcp:43031:156"/>
Humours, and <U+017F>well'd with Drop<U+017F>ie. Even the<U+017F>e too de<U+017F>ert their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, as their Judgment ripens. The young Gentlemen them<U+017F>elves are commonly mi<U+017F>s-led by their <hi>Pedagogue</hi> at School, their Tutor at the Univer<U+017F>ity, or their Governour in their Travels. And many of tho<U+017F>e three <U+017F>orts are the mo<U+017F>t po<U+017F>itive Blockheads in the World. How many of tho<U+017F>e flatulent Writers have I known, who have <U+017F>unk in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, after Seven or Eight Editions of their Works? for indeed they are Poets only for young Men. They had great <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s at their fir<U+017F>t appearance; but not being of God, as a Wit <U+017F>aid formerly, they cou'd not <U+017F>tand.</p>
                  <p>I have already nam'd two <U+017F>orts of Judges, but <hi>Virgil</hi> wrote for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them: and by his Example, I am not ambitious of plea<U+017F>ing the lowe<U+017F>t, or the middle form of Readers.</p>
                  <p>He cho<U+017F>e to plea<U+017F>e the mo<U+017F>t Judicious: Souls of the highe<U+017F>t Rank, and true<U+017F>t Under<U+017F>tanding. The<U+017F>e are few in number; but whoever is <U+017F>o happy as to gain their approbation, can nover lo<U+017F>e it, becau<U+017F>e they never give it blindly. Then they have a certain <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<U+017F>m</hi> in their Judgment, which attracts others to their Sen<U+017F>e. Every day they gain <U+017F>ome new Pro<U+017F>elyte, and in time become the Church. For this Rea<U+017F>on, a well-weigh'd Judicious Poem, which at its fir<U+017F>t ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance gains no more upon the World than to be ju<U+017F>t receiv'd, and rather not blam'd, than much applauded, in<U+017F>inuates it <U+017F>elf by in<U+017F>en<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degrees into the liking of the Reader: The more he <U+017F>tudies it, the more it grows upon him; every time he takes it up, he di<U+017F>covers <U+017F>ome new Graces in it. And whereas Poems which are produc'd by the vigour of Imagination only, have a glo<U+017F>s upon them at the fir<U+017F>t, which Time wears off; the Works of Judgment, are like the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, the more they are poli<U+017F>h'd, the more lu<U+017F>tre they receive. Such is the difference betwixt <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Aeneis,</hi> and <hi>Marini</hi>'s <hi>Adone.</hi> And if I may be allow'd to change the Metaphor, I wou'd <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Virgil</hi> is like the Fame which he de<U+017F>cribes;

                  <p>Such a <U+017F>ort of Reputation is my aim, though in a far inferiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, according to my Motto in the Title Page: <hi>Sequitur<expan>

                  <p>Without this Ambition which I own, of de<U+017F>iring to plea<U+017F>e the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices Natos,</hi> I cou'd never have been able to have done any thing at this Age, when the fire of Poetry is commonly extingui<U+017F>h'd in other Men. Yet <hi>Virgil</hi> has given me the Example of <hi>Entellus</hi> for my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement: When he was well heated, the younger Champion cou'd not <U+017F>tand before him. And we find the Elder contended not for the Gift, but for the Honour; <hi>Nec dona moror.</hi> For <hi>Dampier</hi> has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd us, in his Voyages, that the Air of the Country which produces Gold, is never whol<U+017F>om.</p>
                  <p>I had long <U+017F>ince con<U+017F>ider'd, that the way to plea<U+017F>e the be<U+017F>t Judges, is not to Tran<U+017F>late a Poet literally; and <hi>Virgil</hi> lea<U+017F>t of any other. For his peculiar Beauty lying in his choice of Words, I am excluded from it by the narrow compa<U+017F>s of our Heroick Ver<U+017F>e, unle<U+017F>s I wou'd make u<U+017F>e of Mono<U+017F>yllables only, and tho<U+017F>e clog'd with Con<U+017F>onants, which
<pb facs="tcp:43031:157"/>
are the dead weight of our Mother-Tongue. 'Tis po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, I confe<U+017F>s, though it rarely happens, that a Ver<U+017F>e of Mono<U+017F>yllables may <U+017F>ound harmoniou<U+017F>ly; and <U+017F>ome Examples of it I have <U+017F>een. My fir<U+017F>t Line of the <hi>Aeneis</hi> is not har<U+017F>h:
<q>
                        <hi>Arms, and the Man I Sing, who forc'd by Fate,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But a much better in<U+017F>tance may be given from the la<U+017F>t Line of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilius,</hi> made Engli<U+017F>h by our Learned and Judicious Mr. <hi>Creech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Nor could the World have born <U+017F>o fierce a Flame.</q>
                  <p>Where the many Liquid Con<U+017F>onants are plac'd <U+017F>o Artfully, that they give a plea<U+017F>ing <U+017F>ound to the Words, though they are all of one Syllable.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, I have been <U+017F>ometimes forc'd upon it in other places of this Work, but I never did it out of choice: I was either in ha<U+017F>te, or <hi>Virgil</hi> gave me no occa<U+017F>ion for the Ornament of Words; for it <U+017F>eldom happens but a Mono<U+017F>yllable Line turns Ver<U+017F>e to Pro<U+017F>e, and even that Pro<U+017F>e is rugged, and unharmonious. <hi>Philarchus,</hi> I remember, taxes <hi>Balzac</hi> for placing Twenty Mono<U+017F>yllables in file, without one di<U+017F><U+017F>yllable betwixt them. The way I have taken, is not <U+017F>o <U+017F>treight as Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phra<U+017F>e, nor <U+017F>o loo<U+017F>e as Paraphra<U+017F>e: Some things too I have omitted, and <U+017F>ometimes have added of my own. Yet the omi<U+017F><U+017F>ions I hope, are but of Circum<U+017F>tances, and <U+017F>uch as wou'd have no grace in Engli<U+017F>h; and the Additions, I al<U+017F>o hope, are ea<U+017F>ily deduc'd from <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Sen<U+017F>e. They will <U+017F>eem (at lea<U+017F>t I have the Vanity to think <U+017F>o), not <U+017F>tuck into him, but growing out of him. He <U+017F>tudies brevity more than any other Poet, but he had the advantage of a Language wherein much may be comprehended in a little <U+017F>pace. We, and all the Modern Tongues, have more Articles and Pronouns, be<U+017F>ides <U+017F>igns of Ten<U+017F>es and Ca<U+017F>es, and other Barbarities on which our Speech is built by the faults of our Forefathers. The <hi>Romans</hi> founded theirs upon the <hi>Greek:</hi> And the <hi>Greeks,</hi> we know, were labouring many hundred years upon their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, before they brought it to perfection. They rejected all tho<U+017F>e Signs, and cut off as many Articles as they cou'd <U+017F>pare; comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one word, what we are con<U+017F>train'd to expre<U+017F>s in two; which is one Rea<U+017F>on why we cannot write <U+017F>o conci<U+017F>ely as they have done. The word <hi>Pater,</hi> for Example, <U+017F>ignifies not only a Father, but your Father, my Father, his or her Father, all included in a word.</p>
                  <p>This inconvenience is common to all Modern Tongues, and this alone con<U+017F>trains us to employ more words than the Ancients needed. But having before ob<U+017F>erv'd, that <hi>Virgil</hi> endeavours to be <U+017F>hort, and at the <U+017F>ame time Elegant, I pur<U+017F>ue the Excellence, and for<U+017F>ake the Brevity. For there he is like Ambergreace, a Rich Perfume, but of <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e and glutinous a Body, that it mu<U+017F>t be open'd with inferiour <U+017F>cents of Musk or Civet, or the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s will not be drawn out into another Language.</p>
                  <p>On the whole Matter, I thought fit to <U+017F>teer betwixt the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, of Paraphra<U+017F>e, and literal Tran<U+017F>lation: To keep as near my Author as I cou'd, without lo<U+017F>ing all his Graces, the mo<U+017F>t Eminent of which, are in the Beauty of his words: And tho<U+017F>e words, I mu<U+017F>t add, are always Figurative. Such of the<U+017F>e as wou'd retain their Elegance in our Tongue, I have endeavour'd to graff on it; but mo<U+017F>t
<pb facs="tcp:43031:157"/>
of them are of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to be lo<U+017F>t, becau<U+017F>e they will not <U+017F>hine in any but their own. <hi>Virgil</hi> has <U+017F>ometimes two of them in a Line; but the <U+017F>cantine<U+017F>s of our Heroick Ver<U+017F>e, is not capable of receiving more than one: And that too mu<U+017F>t expiate for many others which have none. Such is the difference of the Languages, or <U+017F>uch my want of skill in chu<U+017F>ing words. Yet I may pre<U+017F>ume to <U+017F>ay, and I hope with as much rea<U+017F>on as the <hi>French</hi> Tran<U+017F>lator, that taking all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of this divine Author, I have endeavour'd to make <hi>Virgil</hi> <U+017F>peak <U+017F>uch Engli<U+017F>h, as he wou'd him<U+017F>elf have <U+017F>poken, if he had been born in <hi>England,</hi> and in this pre<U+017F>ent Age. I acknowledge, with <hi>Segrais,</hi> that I have not <U+017F>ucceeded in this attempt, according to my de<U+017F>ire: yet I <U+017F>hall not be wholly without prai<U+017F>e, if in <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort I may be allow'd to have copied the Clearne<U+017F>s, the Purity, the Ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s and the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of his Stile. But I <U+017F>hall have occa<U+017F>ion to <U+017F>peak farther on this Subject, before I end the Preface.</p>
                  <p>When I mention'd the Pindarick Line, I <U+017F>hould have added, that I take another Licen<U+017F>e in my Ver<U+017F>es: For I frequently make u<U+017F>e of Triplet Rhymes, and for the <U+017F>ame Rea<U+017F>on: Becau<U+017F>e they bound the Sen<U+017F>e. And therefore I generally join the<U+017F>e two Licen<U+017F>es together: And make the la<U+017F>t Ver<U+017F>e of the Triplet a Pindarique: For be<U+017F>ides, the Maje<U+017F>ty which it gives, it confines the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e within the barriers of three Lines, which wou'd langui<U+017F>h if it were lengthen'd into four. <hi>Spencer</hi> is my Example for both the<U+017F>e priviledges of <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Ver<U+017F>es. And <hi>Chapman</hi> has follow'd him in his Tran<U+017F>lation of <hi>Homer.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> has given in to them after both: And all <U+017F>ucceeding Writers after him. I regard them now as the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of Heroick Poetry; and am too much an <hi>Engli<U+017F>h-</hi>man to lo<U+017F>e what my Ance<U+017F>tors have gain'd for me. Let the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> value them<U+017F>elves on their Regularity: Strength and Elevation are our Standard. I <U+017F>aid before, and I repeat it, that the affected purity of the <hi>French,</hi> has un<U+017F>inew'd their Heroick Ver<U+017F>e. The Language of an Epick Poem is almo<U+017F>t wholly figurative: Yet they are <U+017F>o fearful of a Metaphor, that no Example of <hi>Virgil</hi> can encourage them to be bold with <U+017F>afety. Sure they might warm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves by that <U+017F>prightly Blaze, without approaching it <U+017F>o clo<U+017F>e as to <U+017F>inge their Wings; they may come as near it as their Ma<U+017F>ter. Not that I wou'd di<U+017F>courage that purity of diction, in which he excels all other Poets. But he knows how far to extend his Franchi<U+017F>es: And advances to the verge, without venturing a Foot beyond it. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <U+017F>ide, without being injurious to the Memory of our <hi>Engli<U+017F>h Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi> I will pre<U+017F>ume to <U+017F>ay, that his Metaphors are <U+017F>ometimes too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and his Language is not always pure. But at the <U+017F>ame time, I mu<U+017F>t excu<U+017F>e him. For through the Iniquity of the times, he was forc'd to Travel, at an Age, when, in<U+017F>tead of Learning Foreign Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, he <U+017F>hou'd have <U+017F>tudied the Beauties of his Mother Tongue: Which like all other Speeches, is to be cultivated early, or we <U+017F>hall never Write it with any kind of Elegance. Thus by gaining abroad he lo<U+017F>t at home: Like the Painter in the <hi>Arcadia,</hi> who going to <U+017F>ee a Skirmi<U+017F>h, had his Arms lop'd off: and return'd, <U+017F>ays Sir <hi>Philip Sydney,</hi> well in<U+017F>tructed how to draw a Battel, but without a Hand to perform his Work.</p>
                  <p>There is another thing in which I have pre<U+017F>um'd to deviate from him and <hi>Spencer.</hi> They both make Hemy<U+017F>ticks (or half Ver<U+017F>es) breaking off in the middle of a Line. I confe<U+017F>s there are not many <U+017F>uch in the <hi>Fairy Queen:</hi> And even tho<U+017F>e few might be occa<U+017F>ion'd by his unhappy choice
<pb facs="tcp:43031:158"/>
of <U+017F>o long a Stanza. Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> had found out, that no kind of Staff is proper for an Heroick Poem; as being all too lirical: Yet though he wrote in Couplets, where Rhyme is freer from con<U+017F>traint, he frequently affects half Ver<U+017F>es: of which we find not one in <hi>Homer,</hi> and I think not in any of the <hi>Grcek</hi> Poets, or the Latin, excepting only <hi>Virgil;</hi> and there is no que<U+017F>tion but he thought, he had <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for that Licen<U+017F>e. But I am confident, our Poet never meant to leave him or any other <U+017F>uch a Precedent. And I ground my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on the<U+017F>e two Rea<U+017F>ons. Fir<U+017F>t, we find no Example of a Hemy<U+017F>tick in any of his Pa<U+017F>torals or <hi>Georgicks.</hi> For he had given the la<U+017F>t fini<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Strokes to both the<U+017F>e Poems: But his <hi>Aeneis</hi> he left <U+017F>o uncorrect, at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>o <U+017F>hort of that perfection at which he aim'd, that we know how hard a Sentence He pa<U+017F>s'd upon it: And in the <U+017F>econd place, I rea<U+017F>onably pre<U+017F>ume, that he intended to have fill'd up all tho<U+017F>e <hi>Hemy<U+017F>ticks,</hi> becau<U+017F>e in one of them we find the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e imperfect:

On the<U+017F>e Con<U+017F>iderations I have <U+017F>hun'd <hi>Hemy<U+017F>ticks:</hi> Not being willing to imitate <hi>Virgil</hi> to a Fault; like <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Courtiers, who affected to hold their Necks awry, becau<U+017F>e he cou'd not help it: I am confident your Lord<U+017F>hip is by this time of my Opinion; and that you will look on tho<U+017F>e half lines hereafter, as the imperfect products of a ha<U+017F>ty Mu<U+017F>e: Like the Frogs and Serpents in the <hi>Nile;</hi> part of them kindled into Life; and part a lump of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd unanimated Mudd.</p>
                  <p>I am <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible that many of my whole Ver<U+017F>es, are as imperfect as tho<U+017F>e halves; for want of time to dige<U+017F>t them better: But give me leave to make the Excu<U+017F>e of <hi>Boccace:</hi> Who when he was upbraided, that <U+017F>ome of his Novels had not the Spirit of the re<U+017F>t, return'd this An<U+017F>wer, that <hi>Charlemain</hi> who made the <hi>Paladins;</hi> was never able to rai<U+017F>e an Army of them. The Leaders may be Heroes, but the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t of Common Men.</p>
                  <p>I am al<U+017F>o bound to tell your Lord<U+017F>hip, in my own defence: That from the beginning of the fir<U+017F>t <hi>Georgick</hi> to the end of the la<U+017F>t <hi>Aeneid;</hi> I found the difficulty of Tran<U+017F>lation growing on me in every <U+017F>ucceeding Book. For <hi>Virgil,</hi> above all Poets, had a <U+017F>tock, which I may call almo<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhau<U+017F>tible of figurative, Elegant, and <U+017F>ounding Words. I who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit but a <U+017F>mall portion of his Genius, and write in a Language <U+017F>o
<pb facs="tcp:43031:158"/>
much inferiour to the Latin, have found it very painful to vary Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>es, when the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>en<U+017F>e returns upon me. Even he him<U+017F>elf, whether out of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity or choice, has often expre<U+017F>s'd the <U+017F>ame thing in the <U+017F>ame words; and often repeated two or three whole Ver<U+017F>es, which he had us'd before. Words are not <U+017F>o ea<U+017F>ily Coyn'd as Money: And yet we <U+017F>ee that the Credit not only of Banks, but of Exchequers cracks, when little comes in, and much goes out. <hi>Virgil</hi> call'd upon me in every line for <U+017F>ome new word: And I paid <U+017F>o long, that I was almo<U+017F>t Banckrupt. So that the latter end mu<U+017F>t needs be more burden<U+017F>om than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or the middle. And con<U+017F>equently the Twelfth <hi>Aeneid</hi> co<U+017F>t me double the time of the fir<U+017F>t and <U+017F>econd. What had become of me, if <hi>Virgil</hi> had tax'd me with another Book? I had certainly been reduc'd to pay the Publick in hammer'd Money for want of Mill'd; that is in the <U+017F>ame old Words which I had us'd before: And the Receivers mu<U+017F>t have been forc'd to have taken any thing, where there was <U+017F>o little to be had.</p>
                  <p>Be<U+017F>ides this difficulty (with which I have <U+017F>trugled, and made a <U+017F>hift to pa<U+017F>s it over) there is one remaining, which is in<U+017F>uperable to all Tran<U+017F>lators. We are bound to our Author's Sen<U+017F>e, though with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes already mention'd (for I think it not <U+017F>o <U+017F>acred, as that one Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta mu<U+017F>t not be added or dimini<U+017F>h'd on pain of an <hi>Anathema.)</hi> But Slaves we are; and labour on another Man's Plantation; we dre<U+017F>s the Vine-yard, but the Wine is the Owners: If the Soil be <U+017F>ometimes Barren, then we are <U+017F>ure of being <U+017F>courg'd: If it be fruitful, and our Care <U+017F>ucceeds, we are not thank'd; for the proud Reader will only <U+017F>ay, the poor drudge has done his duty. But this is nothing to what follows; for being oblig'd to make his Sen<U+017F>e intelligible, we are forc'd to untune our own Ver<U+017F>es, that we may give his meaning to the Reader. He who Invents is Ma<U+017F>ter of his Thoughts and Words: He can turn and vary them as he plea<U+017F>es, 'till he renders them harmonious. But the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tran<U+017F>lator has no <U+017F>uch priviledge: For being ty'd to the Thoughts, he mu<U+017F>t make what Mu<U+017F>ick he can in the Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on it cannot always be <U+017F>o <U+017F>weet as that of the Original. There is a beauty of Sound, as <hi>Segrais</hi> has ob<U+017F>erv'd, in <U+017F>ome Latin Words, which is wholly lo<U+017F>t in any Modern Language. He in<U+017F>tances in that <hi>Mollis Amaracus,</hi> on which <hi>Venus</hi> lays <hi>Cupid</hi> in the Fir<U+017F>t <hi>Aeneid.</hi> If I <U+017F>hould Tran<U+017F>late it Sweet Marjoram, as the word <U+017F>ignifies; the Reader would think I had mi<U+017F>taken <hi>Virgil:</hi> For tho<U+017F>e Village-words, as I may call them, gives us a mean Idea of the thing; but the Sound of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin is <U+017F>o much more plea<U+017F>ing, by the ju<U+017F>t mixture of the Vowels with the Con<U+017F>onants, that it rai<U+017F>es our Fancies, to conceive <U+017F>omewhat more Noble than a common Herb; and to <U+017F>pread Ro<U+017F>es under him, and <U+017F>trew Lillies over him; a Bed not unworthy the Grand<U+017F>on of the Godde<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>If I cannot Copy his Harmonious Numbers, how <U+017F>hall I imitate his noble Flights; where his Thoughts and Words are equally <U+017F>ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime?</p>

For my part I am lo<U+017F>t in the admiration of it: I contemn the World, when I think on it, and my <U+017F>elf when I Tran<U+017F>late it.</p>
                  <p>Lay by <hi>Virgil,</hi> I be<U+017F>eech your Lord<U+017F>hip, and all my better <U+017F>ort of Judges, when you take up my Ver<U+017F>ion, and it will appear a pa<U+017F><U+017F>able Beauty, when the Original Mu<U+017F>e is ab<U+017F>ent: But like <hi>Spencer</hi>'s fal<U+017F>e <hi>Florimel</hi> made of Snow, it melts and vani<U+017F>hes, when the true one comes in <U+017F>ight. I will not excu<U+017F>e but ju<U+017F>tifie my <U+017F>elf for one pretended Crime, with which I am liable to be charg'd by fal<U+017F>e Criticks, not only in this Tran<U+017F>lation, but in many of my Original Poems; that I latinize too much. 'Tis true, that when I find an <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> word, <U+017F>ignificant and <U+017F>ounding, I neither borrow from the Latin or any other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: But when I want at home, I mu<U+017F>t <U+017F>eek abroad.</p>
                  <p>If <U+017F>ounding Words are not of our growth and Manufacture, who <U+017F>hall hinder me to Import them from a Foreign Country? I carry not out the Trea<U+017F>ure of the Nation, which is never to return: but what I bring from <hi>Italy,</hi> I <U+017F>pend in <hi>England:</hi> Here it remains, and here it cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates; for if the Coyn be good, it will pa<U+017F>s from one hand to another. I Trade both with the Living and the Dead, for the enrichment of our Native Language. We have enough in <hi>England</hi> to <U+017F>upply our nece<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but if we will have things of Magnificence and Splendour, we mu<U+017F>t get them by Commerce. Poetry requires Ornament, and that is not to be had from our Old <hi>Teuton</hi> Mono<U+017F>yllables; therefore if I find any Elegant Word in a Cla<U+017F><U+017F>ick Author, I propo<U+017F>e it to be Naturaliz'd, by u<U+017F>ing it my <U+017F>elf: and if the Publick approves of it, the Bill pa<U+017F><U+017F>es. But every Man cannot di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h betwixt Pedantry and Poetry: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man therefore is not fit to innovate. Upon the whole matter, a Poet mu<U+017F>t fir<U+017F>t be certain that the Word he wou'd Introduce is Beautiful in the Latin; and is to con<U+017F>ider, in the next place, whether it will agree with the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Idiom: After this, he ought to take the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of judicious Friends, <U+017F>uch as are Learned in both Languages: And la<U+017F>tly, <U+017F>ince no Man is infallible, let him u<U+017F>e this Licen<U+017F>e very <U+017F>paringly; for if too many Foreign Words are pour'd in upon us, it looks as if they were de<U+017F>ign'd not to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t the Natives, but to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer them.</p>
                  <p>I am now drawing towards a Conclu<U+017F>ion, and <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect your Lord<U+017F>hip is very glad of it. But permit me fir<U+017F>t, to own what Helps I have had in this Undertaking. The late Earl of <hi>Lauderdail,</hi> <U+017F>ent me over his new Tran<U+017F>lation of the <hi>Aeneis;</hi> which he had ended before I ingag'd in the <U+017F>ame De<U+017F>ign. Neither did I then intend it: But <U+017F>ome Propo<U+017F>als being afterwards made me by my Book<U+017F>eller, I de<U+017F>ir'd his Lord<U+017F>hip's leave, that I might accept them, which he freely granted; and I have his Letter yet to <U+017F>hew, for that permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion. He re<U+017F>olv'd to have Printed his Work; which he might have done two Years before I cou'd Publi<U+017F>h mine: and had perform'd it, if Death had not prevented him. But having his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu<U+017F>cript in my hands, I con<U+017F>ulted it as often as I doubted of my Author's <U+017F>en<U+017F>e. For no Man under<U+017F>tood <hi>Virgil</hi> better than that Learned Noble Man. His Friends, I hear, have yet another, and more Correct Copy of that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>lation
<pb facs="tcp:43031:159"/>
by them: which had they pleas'd to have given the Publick, the Judges mu<U+017F>t have been convinc'd, that I have not flatter'd him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ides this help, which was not incon<U+017F>iderable, Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> has done me the Favour to review the <hi>Aeneis;</hi> and compare my Ver<U+017F>ion with the Original. I <U+017F>hall never be a<U+017F>ham'd to own, that this Excellent Young Man, has <U+017F>hew'd me many Faults, which I have endeavour'd to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. 'Tis true, he might have ea<U+017F>ily found more, and then my Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>lation had been more Perfect.</p>
                  <p>Two other Worthy Friends of mine, who de<U+017F>ire to have their Names conceal'd, <U+017F>eeing me <U+017F>traitned in my time, took Pity on me, and gave me the Life of <hi>Virgil,</hi> the two Prefaces to the Pa<U+017F>torals, and the <hi>Georgics,</hi> and all the Arguments in Profe to the whole Tran<U+017F>lation. Which perhaps, has occa<U+017F>ion'd a Report that the two Fir<U+017F>t Poems are not mine. If it had been true, that I had taken their Ver<U+017F>es for my own, I might have glory'd in their Aid; and like <hi>Terence,</hi> have farther'd the Opinion, that <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> join'd with me. But the <U+017F>ame Style being continu'd thro' the whole, and the <U+017F>ame Laws of Ver<U+017F>ifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ob<U+017F>erv'd, are proofs <U+017F>ufficient, that this is one Man's Work: And your Lord<U+017F>hip is too well acquainted with my manner, to doubt that any part of it is anothers.</p>
                  <p>That your Lord<U+017F>hip may <U+017F>ee I was in earne<U+017F>t, when I promis'd to ha<U+017F>ten to an end, I will not give the Rea<U+017F>ons, why I Writ not always in the proper terms of Navigation, Land-Service, or in the Cant of any Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion. I will only <U+017F>ay, that <hi>Virgil</hi> has avoided tho<U+017F>e proprieties, becau<U+017F>e he Writ not to Mariners, Souldiers, A<U+017F>tronomers, Gardners, Pea<U+017F>ants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to all in general, and in particular to Men and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the fir<U+017F>t Quality: who have been better Bred than to be too nicely knowing in the Terms. In <U+017F>uch ca<U+017F>es, 'tis enough for a Poet to write <U+017F>o plainly, that he may be under<U+017F>tood by his Readers: To avoid impropriety, and not affect to be thought Learn'd in all things.</p>
                  <p>I have omitted the Four Preliminary Lines of the Fir<U+017F>t <hi>Aeneid:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e I think them inferiour to any Four others, in the whole Poem: and con<U+017F>equently, believe they are not <hi>Virgil</hi>'s. There is too great a gap betwixt the Adjective <hi>vicina</hi> in the Second Line, and the Sub<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Arva</hi> in the latter end of the Third, which keeps his meaning in ob<U+017F>curity too long: And is contrary to the clearne<U+017F>s of his Style.

'Tis a meer filler; to <U+017F>top a vacancy in the Hexameter, and connect the Preface to the Work of <hi>Virgil.</hi> Our Author <U+017F>eems to <U+017F>ound a Charge, and begins like the clangour of a Trumpet;

                  <p>Scarce a word without an <hi>R.</hi> and the Vowels for the greater part <U+017F>onorous. The Prefacer began with <hi>Ille ego,</hi> which He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>train'd to patch up in the Fourth line with <hi>At nunc,</hi> to make the Sen<U+017F>e cohere. And if both tho<U+017F>e words are not notorious botches, I am much deceiv'd, though the <hi>French</hi> Tran<U+017F>lator thinks other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<U+017F>e.

                  <p>I know it may be an<U+017F>wer'd by <U+017F>uch as think <hi>Virgil</hi> the Author of the four Lines; that he a<U+017F><U+017F>erts his Title to the <hi>Aeneis,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Work, as he did to the two former, in the la<U+017F>t lines of the fourth <hi>Georgic.</hi> I will not reply otherwi<U+017F>e to this, than by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iring them to compare the<U+017F>e four Lines with the four others; which we know are his, becau<U+017F>e no Poet but he alone could write them.

But I have done great Wrong to <hi>Virgil</hi> in the whole Tran<U+017F>lation: Want of Time, the Inferiority of our Language; the inconvenience of Rhyme, and all the other Excu<U+017F>es I have made, may alleviate my Fault, but cannot ju<U+017F>ti<U+017F>ie the boldne<U+017F>s of my Undertaking.

For even my own Confe<U+017F><U+017F>ion makes again<U+017F>t me; and it will always be return'd upon me, Why then did you attempt it? To which, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther An<U+017F>wer can be made, than that I have done him le<U+017F>s Injury than any of his former Libellers.</p>
                  <p>What they call'd his Picture, had been drawn at length, <U+017F>o many times, by the Daubers of almo<U+017F>t all Nations, and <U+017F>till <U+017F>o unlike him, that I <U+017F>natch'd up the Pencil with di<U+017F>dain: being <U+017F>atisfi'd before hand, that I cou'd make <U+017F>ome <U+017F>mall re<U+017F>emblance of him, though I mu<U+017F>t be content with a wor<U+017F>e likene<U+017F>s. A Sixth Pa<U+017F>toral, a <hi>Pharmaceutria,</hi> a <U+017F>ingle <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and <U+017F>ome other Features, have been exactly taken: But tho<U+017F>e Holiday Authors writ for Plea<U+017F>ure; and only <U+017F>hew'd us what they cou'd have done, if they wou'd have taken pains, to perform the whole.</p>
                  <p>Be pleas'd, My Lord, to accept, with your wonted goodne<U+017F>s, this unworthy Pre<U+017F>ent, which I make you. I have taken off one trouble from you, of defending it, by acknowledging its Imperfections: And though <U+017F>ome part of them are cover'd in the Ver<U+017F>e; (as <hi>Erictho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>

rode always in a Chariot, to hide his lamene<U+017F>s.) Such of them as cannot be conceal'd, you will plea<U+017F>e to connive at, though in the <U+017F>trictne<U+017F>s of your Judgment, you cannot Pardon. If <hi>Homer</hi> was allow'd to nod <U+017F>ometimes, in <U+017F>o long a Work, it will be no wonder if I often fall a<U+017F>leep. You took my <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> into your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, with all his faults: And I hope here cannot be <U+017F>o many, becau<U+017F>e I Tran<U+017F>late an Author, who gives me <U+017F>uch Examples of Correctne<U+017F>s. What my Jury may be, I know not; but 'tis good for a Criminal to plead before a favourable Judge: If I had <U+017F>aid Partial, wou'd your Lord<U+017F>hip have forgiven me? Or will you give me leave to acquaint the World, that I have many times been oblig'd to your Bounty <U+017F>ince the Revolution. Though I never was reduc'd to beg a Charity, nor ever had the Impudence to ask one, either of your Lord<U+017F>hip, or your Noble Kin<U+017F>man the Earl of <hi>Dor<U+017F>et,</hi> much le<U+017F>s of any other, yet when I lea<U+017F>t expected it, you have both remember'd me. So inherent it is in your Family not to forget an Old Servant. It looks rather like Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude on my part, that where I have been <U+017F>o often oblig'd, I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd <U+017F>o <U+017F>eldom to return my thanks: and where I was al<U+017F>o <U+017F>o <U+017F>ure of being well receiv'd. Somewhat of Lazine<U+017F>s was in the ca<U+017F>e; and <U+017F>omewhat too of Mode<U+017F>ty: But nothing of Di<U+017F>re<U+017F>pect, or of Unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne<U+017F>s. I will not <U+017F>ay that your Lord<U+017F>hip has encourag'd me to this Pre<U+017F>umption, le<U+017F>t if my Labours meet with no <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s in Publick, I may expo<U+017F>e your Judgment to be Cen<U+017F>ur'd. As for my own Enemies I <U+017F>hall never think them worth an An<U+017F>wer; and if your Lord<U+017F>hip has any, they will not dare to Arraign you for your want of Knowledge in this Art, till they can produce <U+017F>omewhat betterof their own, than your <hi>E<U+017F><U+017F>ay</hi> on Poetry. 'Twas on this Con<U+017F>ideration, that I have drawn out my Preface to <U+017F>o great a length. Had I not addre<U+017F>s'd to a Poet, and a Critick of the fir<U+017F>t Magnitude, I had my <U+017F>elf been tax'd for want of Judgment, and <U+017F>ham'd my Patron for want of Under<U+017F>tanding. But neither will you, My Lord, <U+017F>o <U+017F>oon be tir'd as any other, becau<U+017F>e the Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e is on your Art; Neither will the Learned Reader think it tedious, becau<U+017F>e it is <hi>ad Clerum.</hi> At lea<U+017F>t, when he begins to be weary, the Church Doors are open. That I may pur<U+017F>ue the Allegory with a <U+017F>hort Prayer, after a long Sermon:</p>
                  <p>May you Live happily and long, for the Service of your Country, the Encouragement of good Letters and the Ornament of Poetry; which cannot be wi<U+017F>h'd more earne<U+017F>tly by any Man, than by</p>

                  <p>WHAT <hi>Virgil</hi> wrote in the vigour of his Age, in Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and at Ea<U+017F>e, I have undertaken to <hi>Tran<U+017F>late</hi> in my Declining Years: <U+017F>trugling with Wants, oppre<U+017F>s'd with Sickne<U+017F>s, curb'd in my Genius, lyable to be mi<U+017F>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trued in all I write; and my Judges, if they are not very equitable, already prejudic'd again<U+017F>t me, by the <hi>Lying Character</hi> which has been given them of my Morals. Yet <U+017F>teady to my Principles, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pirited with my Afflictions, I have, by the Ble<U+017F><U+017F>ing of God on my Endeavours, overcome all difficulties; and, in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure, acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my <U+017F>elf of the Debt which I ow'd the Publick, when I undertook this Work. In the fir<U+017F>t place therefore, I thankfully acknowledge to the Almighty Power, the A<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance he has given me in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Pro<U+017F>ecution, and <hi>Conclu<U+017F>ion</hi> of my pre<U+017F>ent Studies, which are more happily perform'd than I could have promis'd to my <U+017F>elf, when I labour'd under <U+017F>uch Di<U+017F>couragements. For, what I have done, Imperfect as it is, for want of Health and lei<U+017F>ure to Correct it, will be judg'd in after Ages, and po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly in the pre<U+017F>ent, to be no di<U+017F>honour to my Native Country; who<U+017F>e Language and Poetry wou'd be more e<U+017F>teem'd abroad, if they were better under<U+017F>tood. Somewhat (give me leave to <U+017F>ay) I have added to both of them in the choice of <hi>Words;</hi> and Harmony of Numbers which were wanting, e<U+017F>pecially the la<U+017F>t, in all our Poets, even in tho<U+017F>e who being endu'd with Genius, yet have not Cultivated their Mother-Tongue with <U+017F>ufficient Care; or rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Beauty of their Thoughts, have judg'd the Ornament of Words, and <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of Sound unnece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. One is for raking in <hi>Chaucer</hi> (our <hi>Engli<U+017F>h Ennius)</hi> for antiquated Words, which are never to be reviv'd, but when Sound or Significancy is wanting in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent Language. But many of his de<U+017F>erve not this Redemption, any more than the Crouds of Men who daily die, or are <U+017F>lain for Six-pence in a Battel, merit to be re<U+017F>tor'd to Life, if a Wi<U+017F>h cou'd revive them. Others have no Ear for Ver<U+017F>e, nor choice of Words; nor di<U+017F>tinction of Thoughts; but mingle Farthings with their Gold to make up the Sum. Here is a Field of Satire open'd to me: But <U+017F>ince the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have wholly renounc'd that Talent. For who wou'd give Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ick to the Great when he is uncall'd? To do his Patient no good, and indanger him<U+017F>elf for his Pre<U+017F>cription? Neither am I ignorant, but I may ju<U+017F>tly be Condemn'd for many of tho<U+017F>e Faults, of which I have too liberally Arraign'd others.</p>

'Tis enough for me, if the Government will let me pa<U+017F>s unque<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd. In the mean time, I am oblig'd in gratitude, to return my Thanks to many of them, who have not only di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>h'd me from others of the <U+017F>ame Party, by a particular exception of Grace, but without con<U+017F>idering the Man, have been Bountiful to the Poet: Have encourag'd <hi>Virgil</hi> to <U+017F>peak <U+017F>uch <hi>Engli<U+017F>h,</hi> as I could teach him, and rewarded his Interpreter, for the pains he has taken in bringing him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into <hi>Britain,</hi> by defraying the Charges of his Voyage. Even <hi>Cerberus,</hi> when he had receiv'd the Sop, permitted <hi>Aeneas</hi> to pa<U+017F>s free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Ely<U+017F>ium.</hi> Had it been offer'd me, and I had refus'd it, yet <U+017F>till <U+017F>ome gratitude is due to <U+017F>uch who were willing to oblige me. But how much more to tho<U+017F>e from whom I have receiv'd the Favours which they have offer'd to one of a different Per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion. Among<U+017F>t whom I cannot omit naming the Earls of <hi>Darby</hi> and of <hi>Peterborough.</hi> To the fir<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e, I have not the Honour to be known; and therefore his liberality as much unexpected, as it was unde<U+017F>erv'd. The pre<U+017F>ent Earl of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborough</hi> has been pleas'd long <U+017F>ince to accept the tenders of my Service: His Favours are <U+017F>o frequent to me, that I receive them almo<U+017F>t by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cription. No difference of Intere<U+017F>ts or Opinion have been able to withdraw his Protection from me: And I might ju<U+017F>tly be condemn'd for the mo<U+017F>t unthankful of Mankind, if I did not always pre<U+017F>erve for him a mo<U+017F>t profound Re<U+017F>pect and inviolable Gratitude. I mu<U+017F>t al<U+017F>o add, that if the la<U+017F>t <hi>Aeneid</hi> <U+017F>hine among<U+017F>t its Fellows, 'tis owing to the Commands of Sir <hi>William Trumball,</hi> one of the Principal Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of State, who recommended it, as his Favourite, to my Care: and for his <U+017F>ake particularly I have made it mine. For who wou'd confe<U+017F>s wearine<U+017F>s, when he enjoin'd a fre<U+017F>h Labour? I cou'd not but invoke the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of a Mu<U+017F>e, for this la<U+017F>t Office.</p>

                  <p>Neither am I to forget the Noble Pre<U+017F>ent which was made me by <hi>Gilbert Dolben</hi> 
                     <abbr>E<U+017F>q</abbr> the worthy Son of the late Arch-Bi<U+017F>hop of <hi>York:</hi> who, when I began this Work, enrich'd me with all the <U+017F>everal Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and all the Commentaries of tho<U+017F>e Editions in Latine. Among<U+017F>t which, I cou'd not but prefer the <hi>Dolphins;</hi> as the la<U+017F>t, the <U+017F>horte<U+017F>t, and the mo<U+017F>t Judicious. <hi>Fabrini</hi> I had al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ent me from <hi>Italy;</hi> but either he under<U+017F>tands <hi>Virgil</hi> very imperfectly, or I have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my Author.</p>
                  <p>Being Invited by that worthy Gentleman, Sir <hi>William Bowyer,</hi> to <hi>Denham-Court,</hi> I Tran<U+017F>lated the fir<U+017F>t <hi>Georgic</hi> at his Hou<U+017F>e, and the greate<U+017F>t part of the la<U+017F>t <hi>Aeneid.</hi> A more friendly Entertainment no Man ever found.

The Seventh <hi>Aeneid</hi> was made Engli<U+017F>h at <hi>Burleigh,</hi> the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Abode of the Earl of <hi>Exeter:</hi> In a Village belonging to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily I was born, and under his Roof I endeavour'd to make that <hi>Aeneid</hi> appear in Engli<U+017F>h with as much lu<U+017F>tre as I cou'd: though my Author has not given the fini<U+017F>hing <U+017F>trokes either to it, or to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, as I perhaps cou'd prove in both, if I dur<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>ume to Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici<U+017F>e my Ma<U+017F>ter.</p>
                  <p>By a Letter from <hi>Will. Wal<U+017F>h</hi> of <hi>Abberley</hi> 
                     <abbr>E<U+017F>q</abbr> (who has <U+017F>o long honour'd me with his Friend<U+017F>hip, and who, without flattery, is the be<U+017F>t Critick of our Nation,) I have been inform'd that his Grace the
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:43031:447"/>
Duke of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> has procur'd a Printed Copy of the <hi>Pa<U+017F>torals, Georgics,</hi> and <U+017F>ix fir<U+017F>t <hi>Aeneids,</hi> from my Book<U+017F>eller, and has read them in the Country, together with my Friend. This Noble Per<U+017F>on having been pleas'd to give them a Commendation, which I pre<U+017F>ume not to in<U+017F>ert; has made me vain enough to boa<U+017F>t of <U+017F>o great a favour, and to think I have <U+017F>ucceeded beyond my hopes; the Character of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Judgment, the acutene<U+017F>s of his Wit, and his general Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good Letters, being known as well to all the World, as the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of his di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition, his Humanity, his ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of acce<U+017F>s, and de<U+017F>ire of obliging tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>tand in need of his protection, are known to all who have approach'd him; and to me in particular, who have formerly had the honour of his Conver<U+017F>ation. Whoever has given the World the Tran<U+017F>lation of part of the third <hi>Georgic,</hi> which he calls <hi>The Power of Love,</hi> has put me to <U+017F>ufficient pains to make my own not inferiour to his: As my Lord <hi>Ro<U+017F>common</hi>'s <hi>Silenus</hi> had formerly given me the <U+017F>ame trouble. The mo<U+017F>t Ingenious Mr. <hi>Addi<U+017F>on</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> has al<U+017F>o been as trouble<U+017F>ome to me as the other two, and on the <U+017F>ame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. After his Bees, my latter Swarm is <U+017F>carcely worth the hiving. Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi>'s prai<U+017F>e of a Countrey Life is Excellent; but 'tis rather an imitation of <hi>Virgil,</hi> than a Ver<U+017F>ion. That I have recover'd in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure the health which I had lo<U+017F>t by too much application to this Work, is owing, next to God's Mercy, to the Skill and Care of Dr. <hi>Guibbons,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> the two Ornaments of their Profe<U+017F><U+017F>ion; whom I can only pay by this Acknowledgment. The whole Faculty has always been ready to oblige me: and the only one of them who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to defame me, had it not in his power. I de<U+017F>ire pardon from my Readers for <U+017F>aying <U+017F>o much in relation to my <U+017F>elf, which concerns not them: and with my acknowledgements to all my Sub<U+017F>cribers, have only to add, that the few Notes which follow, are <hi>par maniere d'acquit,</hi> becau<U+017F>e I had oblig'd my <U+017F>elf by Articles, to do <U+017F>omewhat of that kind. The<U+017F>e <U+017F>cattering Ob<U+017F>ervations are rather gue<U+017F><U+017F>es at my Author's meaning in <U+017F>ome pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, than proofs that <U+017F>o he meant. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn'd may have recour<U+017F>e to any Poetical Dictionary in <hi>Engli<U+017F>h,</hi> for the Names of Per<U+017F>ons, Places, or Fables, which the Learned need not: But that little which I <U+017F>ay, is either new or nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary. And the fir<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e qualifications never fails to invite a Reader, if not to plea<U+017F>e him.</p>

I have Tran<U+017F>lated the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>age to this Sen<U+017F>e; that the Infant <U+017F>miling on his Mother, <U+017F>ingles her out from the re<U+017F>t of the Company about him. <hi>Erythraeus, Bembus,</hi> and <hi>Jo<U+017F>eph Scaliger,</hi> are of this Opinion. Yet they and I may be mi<U+017F>taken. For immediately after, we find the<U+017F>e words, <hi>Cui non ri<U+017F>ere Parentes,</hi> which imply another Sen<U+017F>e, as if the Parents <U+017F>mil'd on the New-born Infant: And that the Babe on whom they vouch<U+017F>af'd not to <U+017F>mile, was born to ill Fortune. For they tell a Story, that when <hi>Vulcan,</hi> the only Son of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> came into the World, he was <U+017F>o hard favour'd, that both his Parents frown'd on him: And <hi>Jupiter</hi> threw him out of Heaven; he fell on the I<U+017F>land <hi>Lemnos,</hi> and was Lame ever afterwards. The la<U+017F>t Line of the Pa<U+017F>toral <U+017F>eems to ju<U+017F>tify this Sen<U+017F>e, <hi>Nec Deus hunc Men<U+017F>â, Dea nec dignata Cubili e<U+017F>t.</hi> For though he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Venus,</hi> yet his Mother <hi>Juno</hi> was not pre<U+017F>ent at the Nuptials to ble<U+017F>s them; as appears by his Wife's Incontinence. They <U+017F>ay al<U+017F>o, that he was bani<U+017F>h'd from the Banquets of the Gods: If <U+017F>o, that Puni<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be of no long continuance, for <hi>Homer</hi> makes him pre<U+017F>ent at their Fea<U+017F>ts; and compo<U+017F>ing a Quarrel betwixt his Parents, with a Bowl of Nectar.

I adhere to my Tran<U+017F>lation, for the<U+017F>e two Rea<U+017F>ons: Fir<U+017F>t, <hi>Virgil</hi> has this following Line. <hi>Matri long a docem tulerunt fa<U+017F>tidia Men<U+017F>es,</hi> as if the Infants <U+017F>miling on his Mother, was a Reward to her for bearing him ten Months in her Body, four Weeks longer than the u<U+017F>ual time. Secondly, <hi>Catullus</hi> is cited by <hi>Jo<U+017F>eph Scaliger,</hi> as favouring this Opinion, in his <hi>Epithalamium</hi> of <hi>Manlius Torquatus.</hi>

                  <p>What if I <U+017F>hou'd <U+017F>teer betwixt the two Extreams, and conclude, that the Infant, who was to be happy, mu<U+017F>t not only <U+017F>mile on his Parents, but al<U+017F>o they on him?

I ob<U+017F>erve farther, that the Ancients thought the Infant who came into the World at the end of the Tenth Month, was Born to <U+017F>ome extraordinary Fortune, good or Bad. Such was the Birth of the late Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> of whom his Mother was not brought to Bed, 'till almo<U+017F>t Eleven Months were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd after his Fathers Death: Yet the College of <hi>Phy<U+017F>icians</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> concluded he was Lawfully begotten.

                  <p>The Eighth and Tenth Pa<U+017F>torals are already Tran<U+017F>lated to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of advantage, by my excellent Friend, Mr. <hi>Stafford.</hi> So is the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi<U+017F>ode</hi> of <hi>Camilla,</hi> in the Eleventh <hi>Eneid.</hi>

                  <p>This Eight Pa<U+017F>toral is Copied by our Author from two <hi>Bucolicks</hi> of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus. Spencer</hi> has follow'd both <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Theocritus,</hi> in the Charms which he employs for Curing <hi>Britomartis</hi> of her Love. But he had al<U+017F>o our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et's <hi>Ceiris</hi> in his Eye: For there not only the Inchantments are to be found; but al<U+017F>o the very Name of <hi>Britomartis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Ninth Pa<U+017F>toral, <hi>Virgil</hi> has made a Collection of many <U+017F>catter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, which he had Tran<U+017F>lated from <hi>Theocritus:</hi> And here he has bound them into a No<U+017F>egay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Georgic</hi> the Fir<U+017F>t. The Poetry of this Book is more <U+017F>ublime than any part of <hi>Virgil,</hi> if I have any Ta<U+017F>te. And if ever I have Copied his Maje<U+017F>tick Stile 'tis here. The Compliment he makes <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t in the beginning, is ill imitated by his Succe<U+017F><U+017F>ors <hi>Lucan</hi> and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> They Dedicated to Tyrants; and their Flatteries are gro<U+017F>s and ful<U+017F>ome. <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Addre<U+017F>s is both more lofty and more ju<U+017F>t. In the three la<U+017F>t Lines of this <hi>Georgic,</hi> I think I have di<U+017F>cover'd a <U+017F>ecret Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Emperour, which none of the Commentators have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd. <hi>Virgil</hi> had ju<U+017F>t before de<U+017F>crib'd the Mi<U+017F>eries which <hi>Rome</hi> had undergone betwixt the <hi>Triumvirs</hi> and the Commonwealth-Party: In the clo<U+017F>e of all, he <U+017F>eems to excu<U+017F>e the Crimes committed by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron

to tho<U+017F>e words I have made my <hi>Tran<U+017F>lation.</hi> 'Tis mo<U+017F>t cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Sun ought not to be omitted; for he is frequently call'd the Life and Soul of all the World: And nothing bids <U+017F>o fair for a vi<U+017F>ible Divinity to tho<U+017F>e who know no better, than that glorious Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary. The <hi>Platoni<U+017F>ts</hi> call God the <hi>Archetypall</hi> Sun, and the Sun the vi<U+017F>ible Deity, the inward vital Spirit in the Center of the Univer<U+017F>e, or that Body to which that Spirit is united, and by which-it exerts it <U+017F>elf mo<U+017F>t powerfully. Now it was the receiv'd Hypothe<U+017F>is among<U+017F>t the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> that the Sun was <U+017F>cituate in the Center of the World: <hi>Plato</hi> had it from them, and was him<U+017F>elf of the <U+017F>ame Opinion; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by a pa<U+017F><U+017F>age in the <hi>Timaeus:</hi> From which Noble Dialogue is this part of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Poem taken.</p>

                  <p>There is no Que<U+017F>tion but <hi>Virgil</hi> here means <hi>Cato</hi> Major, or the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>or.</hi> But the Name of <hi>Cato being</hi> al<U+017F>o mention'd in the Eighth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> I doubt whether he means the <U+017F>ame Man in both places. I have <U+017F>aid in the Preface, that our Poet was of Republican Principles; and have given this for one Rea<U+017F>on of my Opinion, that he prais'd <hi>Cato</hi> in that Line,
<q>
                        <hi>Secreti<U+017F>que piis, his dantem jura</hi> Catonem.</q>
And accordingly plac'd him in the <hi>Ely<U+017F>ian</hi> Fields. <hi>Montaign</hi> thinks this was <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>tican,</hi> the great Enemy of Arbitrary Power, and a profe<U+017F>s'd Foe to <hi>Julius Cae<U+017F>ar. Ruaeus</hi> wou'd per<U+017F>wade us that <hi>Virgil</hi> meant the Cen<U+017F>or. But why <U+017F>hou'd the Poet name <hi>Cato</hi> twice, if he intended the <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on? Our Author is too frugal of his Words and Sen<U+017F>e, to commit Tautologies in either. His Memory was not likely to betray him into <U+017F>uch an Errour. Neverthele<U+017F>s I continue in the <U+017F>ame Opinion, concerning the Principles of our Poet. He declares them <U+017F>ufficiently in this Book: Where he prai<U+017F>es the fir<U+017F>t <hi>Brutus</hi> for expelling the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> giving Liberty to <hi>Rome,</hi> and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Death his own Children, who con<U+017F>pir'd to re<U+017F>tore Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: He calls him only an unhappy Man, for being forc'd to that <U+017F>evere Action.</p>

                  <p>How unpoetically and baldly had this been tran<U+017F>lated; <hi>Thou <U+017F>halt</hi> Marcellus <hi>be!</hi> Yet <U+017F>ome of my Friends were of Opinion, that I mi<U+017F>took the Sen<U+017F>e of <hi>Virgil</hi> in my Tran<U+017F>lation. The <hi>French</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, ob<U+017F>erves nothing on this place; but that it appears by it, the Mourning of <hi>Octavia</hi> was yet fre<U+017F>h, for the lo<U+017F>s of her Son <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> whom <U+017F>he had by her fir<U+017F>t Husband: And who dyed in the Year <hi>aburbe conditâ,</hi> 731. And collects from thence that <hi>Virgil,</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this <hi>Aeneid</hi> before her, in the <U+017F>ame Year, had ju<U+017F>t fini<U+017F>h'd it: That from this time to that of the Poet's Death, was little more than four Years. So that <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing him to have written the whole <hi>Aeneis</hi> in eleven Years; the fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ix Books mu<U+017F>t have taken up <U+017F>even of tho<U+017F>e Years: On which Account the <U+017F>ix la<U+017F>t, mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity be le<U+017F>s correct.</p>
                  <p>Now for the fal<U+017F>e judgment of my Friends, there is but this little to be <U+017F>aid for them; the words of <hi>Virgil,</hi> in the Ver<U+017F>e preceding are the<U+017F>e,
<q>
                        <hi>—Siqua fata a<U+017F>pera rumpas.</hi>
                     </q>
As if the Poet had meant, if you break through your hard De<U+017F>tiny, <U+017F>o as to be born, you <U+017F>hall be call'd <hi>Marcellus:</hi> But this cannot be the Sen<U+017F>e: for though <hi>Marcellus</hi> was born, yet he broke not through tho<U+017F>e hard Decrees, which doom'd him to <U+017F>o immature a death. Much le<U+017F>s can <hi>Virgil</hi> mean, you <U+017F>hall be the <U+017F>ame <hi>Marcellus</hi> by the Tran<U+017F>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of his Soul. For according to the Sy<U+017F>tem of our Author, a Thou<U+017F>and Years mu<U+017F>t be fir<U+017F>t elaps'd, before the Soul can return into a Humane Body; but the fir<U+017F>t <hi>Marcellus</hi> was <U+017F>lain in the <U+017F>econd <hi>Punick</hi> War. And how many hundred Years were yet wanting, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli<U+017F>hing his penance, may with ea<U+017F>e be gather'd, by computing the time betwixt <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus.</hi> By which 'tis plain, that <hi>Virgil</hi> cannot mean the <U+017F>ame <hi>Marcellus;</hi> but one of his De<U+017F>cendants; whom I call a new <hi>Marcellus;</hi> who <U+017F>o much re<U+017F>embled his Ance<U+017F>tor, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in his Features, and his Per<U+017F>on, but certainly in his Military Vertues, that <hi>Virgil</hi> cries out, <hi>quantum in<U+017F>tar in ip<U+017F>o e<U+017F>t!</hi> which I have tran<U+017F>lated,

                  <p>What is pervious to the Sight is clear; and (alluding to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,) the Poet infers <U+017F>uch Dreams are of Divine Revelation.

                     <hi>Amata,</hi> ever partial to the Cau<U+017F>e of <hi>Turnus,</hi> had ju<U+017F>t before de<U+017F>ir'd him, with all manner of earne<U+017F>tne<U+017F>s, not to ingage his Rival in <U+017F>ingle Fight; which was his pre<U+017F>ent Re<U+017F>olution. <hi>Virgil,</hi> though in favour of his Heroe, he never tells us directly, that <hi>Lavinia</hi> preferr'd <hi>Turnus</hi> to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> yet has in<U+017F>inuated this preference twice before. For mark in the <hi>7th Aeneid,</hi> <U+017F>he left her Father, who had promis'd her to <hi>Aeneas</hi> without asking her con<U+017F>ent: And follow'd her Mother into the Woods, with a Troop of <hi>Bacchanals,</hi> where <hi>Amata</hi> <U+017F>ung the Marriage Song, in the Name of <hi>Turnus;</hi> which if <U+017F>he had di<U+017F>lik'd, <U+017F>he might have oppos'd. Then in the <hi>11th. Aeneid,</hi> when her Mother went to the Temple of <hi>Pallas,</hi> to invoke her Aid again<U+017F>t <hi>Aeneas;</hi> whom <U+017F>he calls by no better Name than <hi>Phrygius Praedo, Lavinia</hi> <U+017F>its by her in the <U+017F>ame Chair or Litter, <hi>juxtaque Comes Lavinia Virgo,—O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culos dejecta decoros.</hi> What greater <U+017F>ign of Love, than Fear and Concernment for the Lover? In the lines which I have quoted <U+017F>he not only <U+017F>heds Tears but changes Colour. She had been bred up with <hi>Turnus,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> was wholly a Stranger to her. <hi>Turnus</hi> in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was her fir<U+017F>t Love; and favour'd by her Mother, who had the A<U+017F>cendant over her Father. But I am much deceiv'd, if (be<U+017F>ides what I have <U+017F>aid) there be not a <U+017F>ecret Satire again<U+017F>t the Sex, which is lurking under this De<U+017F>cription of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who <U+017F>eldom <U+017F>peaks well of Women: Better indeed of <hi>Camilla,</hi> than any other; for he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends her Beauty and Valour: Becau<U+017F>e he wou'd concern the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for her Death. But Valour is no very proper Prai<U+017F>e for Woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and Beauty is common to the Sex. He <U+017F>ays al<U+017F>o <U+017F>omewhat of <hi>Andromache,</hi> but tran<U+017F>iently: And his <hi>Venus</hi> is a better Mother than a Wife, for <U+017F>he owns to <hi>Vulcan</hi> <U+017F>he had a Son by another Man. The re<U+017F>t are <hi>Juno</hi>'s, <hi>Diana</hi>'s, <hi>Dido</hi>'s, <hi>Amata</hi>'s, two mad Prophete<U+017F><U+017F>es, three Harpies on Earth, and as many Furies under ground. This Fable of <hi>Lavinia</hi> includes a <U+017F>ecret Moral; that Women in their choice of Husbands, prefer the younger of their Suitors to the Elder; are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of Merit, fond of Hand<U+017F>omne<U+017F>s; and generally <U+017F>peaking, rather hurried away by their Appetite, than govern'd by their Rea<U+017F>on.</p>

                     <hi>Populi Ramani.</hi> this Title apply'd to Kings, is very Modern, and that is all I will <U+017F>ay of it at pre<U+017F>ent: Though the word requires a larger Note. In the word <hi>tuorum,</hi> is included the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of my Tran<U+017F>lation, <hi>Your Father's Land:</hi> Becau<U+017F>e <hi>Saturn</hi> the Father of <hi>Jove,</hi> had govern'd that part of <hi>Italy,</hi> after his expul<U+017F>ion from <hi>Crete.</hi> But that on which I mo<U+017F>t in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t, is the Addre<U+017F>s of the Poet, in this Speech of <hi>Juno. Virgil</hi> was <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible, as I have <U+017F>aid in the Preface, that whatever the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion was, concerning the De<U+017F>cent of the <hi>Romans</hi> from the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans;</hi> yet the Ancient Cu<U+017F>toms, Rites, Laws, and Habits, of tho<U+017F>e <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans</hi> were wholly lo<U+017F>t, and perhaps al<U+017F>o that they had never been: And for this Rea<U+017F>on, he introduces <hi>Juno</hi> in this place; reque<U+017F>ting of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that no Memory might remain of <hi>Troy,</hi> (the Town <U+017F>he hated) that the People hereafter <U+017F>hould not be called <hi>Trojans,</hi> nor retain any thing which belong'd to their Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors. And why might not this al<U+017F>o be concerted betwixt our Author and his Friend <hi>Horace,</hi> to hinder <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> from Re-building <hi>Troy,</hi> and removing thither the Seat of Empire, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign <U+017F>o unplea<U+017F>ing to the <hi>Romans?</hi> But of this, I am not po<U+017F>itive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e I have not con<U+017F>ulted <hi>d'Acier,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the Criticks, to a<U+017F>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the time in which <hi>Horace</hi> writ the <hi>Ode</hi> relating to that Subject.</p>
