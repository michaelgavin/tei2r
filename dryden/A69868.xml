            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FAR be it from me, (My mo<U+017F>t Noble Lord) to think, that any thing which my meanne<U+017F>s can produce, <U+017F>hould be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be offer'd to your Patronage; or that ought which I can <U+017F>ay of you <U+017F>hou'd recommend you farther, to the e<U+017F>teem of good men in this pre<U+017F>ent Age, or to the veneration which will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be paid you by Po<U+017F>terity.

               </gap> other <U+017F>ide, I mu<U+017F>t acknowledg it a great pre<U+017F>umption in me, to make you this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<U+017F>s; and <U+017F>o much the greater, becau<U+017F>e by the common <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage even of contrary parties, yon have been always regarded, as one of the fir<U+017F>t Per<U+017F>ons of the Age, and yet no one Writer has dar'd to tell you <U+017F>o: Whether we have been, all con<U+017F>cious to our <U+017F>elves that it was a needle<U+017F>s labour to give this notice to Mankind, as all men are a<U+017F>ham'd to tell <U+017F>tale news, or that we were ju<U+017F>tly diffident of our own performances, as even <hi>Cicero</hi> is ob<U+017F>erv'd to be in awe when he writes to <hi>Atticus;</hi> where knowing him<U+017F>elf overmatch'd in good <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, and truth of knowledg, he drops the gawdy train of words, and is no longer the vain-glorious Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. From whatever rea<U+017F>on it may be, I am the fir<U+017F>t bold offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this kind: I have broken down the fence, and ventur'd into the Holy Grove; how I may be puni<U+017F>h'd for my profane attempt, I know not; but I wi<U+017F>h it may not be of ill Omen to your Lord<U+017F>hip; and that a crowd of bad Writers, do not ru<U+017F>h into the quiet of your rece<U+017F><U+017F>es after me. Every man in all chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Government, which have been, or may po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly arrive, will agree, that I cou'd not have offer'd my Incen<U+017F>e, where it cou'd be <U+017F>o well de<U+017F>erv'd. For you, My Lord, are <U+017F>ecure in your own merit; and all Parties, as they ri<U+017F>e uppermo<U+017F>t, are <U+017F>ure to court you in their turns; 'tis a tribute which has ever been paid your vertue: The leading men <U+017F>till bring their bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion to your mint, to receive the <U+017F>tamp of their intrin<U+017F>ick value, that they may afterwards hope to pa<U+017F>s with human kind.

ri<U+017F>e and fall in the variety of Revolutions; and are <U+017F>ometimes great, and therefore wi<U+017F>e in mens opinions, who mu<U+017F>t court them for their intere<U+017F>t: But the reputation of their parts mo<U+017F>t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly follows their <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s; few of 'em are wi<U+017F>e, but as they are in power: Becau<U+017F>e indeed, they have no <U+017F>phere of their own, but like the Moon in the Copernican Sy<U+017F>teme of the World, are whirl'd about by the motion of a greater Planet. This it is to be ever bu<U+017F>ie; neither to give re<U+017F>t to their Fellow creatures, nor, which is more wretchedly ridiculous, to them<U+017F>elves: Tho truly, the latter is a kind of ju<U+017F>tice, and giving Mankind a due revenge, that they will not permit their own hearts to be at qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, who di<U+017F>turb the repo<U+017F>e of all be<U+017F>ide them. Ambitious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors! how willing they are to <U+017F>et them<U+017F>elves upon the Wing; and taking every occa<U+017F>ion of drawing upward to the Sun: Not con<U+017F>idering that they have no more time allow'd them for their mounting, than the <U+017F>hort revolution of a day: and that when the light goes from them, they are of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity to fall. How much happier is he, (and who he is I need not <U+017F>ay, for there is but one Phoenix in an Age,) who centring on him<U+017F>elf, remains immovable, and <U+017F>miles at the madne<U+017F>s of the dance about him. He po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>es the mid<U+017F>t, which is the portion of <U+017F>afety and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: He will not be higher, becau<U+017F>e he needs it not; but by the prudence of that choice, he puts it out of Fortunes power to throw him down. 'Tis confe<U+017F>t, that if he had not <U+017F>o been born, he might have been too high for happine<U+017F>s; but not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to a<U+017F>cend, he <U+017F>ecures the native height of his <U+017F>tation from envy; and cannot de<U+017F>cend from what he is, becau<U+017F>e he depends not on another. What a glorious Character was this once in <hi>Rome;</hi> I <U+017F>hou'd <U+017F>ay in <hi>Athens,</hi> when in the di<U+017F>turbances of a State as mad as ours, the wi<U+017F>e <hi>Pomponius</hi> tran<U+017F>ported all the remaining wi<U+017F>dom and vertue of his Country, into the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of Peace and Learning. But, I wou'd ask the World, (for you, My Lord, are too nearly concern'd to judge this Cau<U+017F>e) whether there may not yet be found, a Character of a Noble Engli<U+017F>hman, equally <U+017F>hining with that illu<U+017F>trious <hi>Roman</hi>? Whether I need to name a <U+017F>econd <hi>Atticus;</hi> or whether the World has not already prevented me, and fix'd it there without my naming.

Both of them knew Mankind exactly well; for both of them began that <U+017F>tudy in them<U+017F>elves; and there they found the be<U+017F>t part of humane compo<U+017F>ition, the wor<U+017F>t they learn'd by long experience of the folly, ignorance, and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of mo<U+017F>t be<U+017F>ide them. Their Philo<U+017F>ophy on both <U+017F>ides, was not wholly <U+017F>peculative, for that is barren, and produces nothing but vain Ideas of things which cannot po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly be known; or if they cou'd, yet wou'd only terminate in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding; but it was a noble, vigorous, and practical Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophy, which exerted it <U+017F>elf in all the offices of pity, to tho<U+017F>e who were unfortunate, and de<U+017F>erv'd not <U+017F>o to be. The Friend was always more con<U+017F>ider'd by them than the cau<U+017F>e: And an <hi>Octavius,</hi> or an <hi>Anthony</hi> in di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s, were reliev'd by them, as well as a <hi>Brutus</hi> or a <hi>Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ius.</hi> For the lowermo<U+017F>t party to a noble mind, is ever the fitte<U+017F>t object of good will.

For <U+017F>tiffne<U+017F>s of Opinion is the effect

of Pride, and not of Philo<U+017F>ophy: 'Tis a mi<U+017F>erable Pre<U+017F>ump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that knowledg which humane Nature is too narrow to contain. And the ruggedne<U+017F>s of a Stoick is only a <U+017F>illy affectation of being a God: To wind him<U+017F>elf up by Pulleys, to an in<U+017F>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ibility of <U+017F>uffering; and at the <U+017F>ame time to give the lye to his own Experience, by <U+017F>aying he <U+017F>uffers not, what he knows he feels. True, Philo<U+017F>ophy is certainly of a more pliant Nature, and more accommodated to human u<U+017F>e; <hi>Homo <U+017F>um, humani à me nihil alienum puto.</hi> A wi<U+017F>e man will never attempt an impo<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and <U+017F>uch it is to <U+017F>train him<U+017F>elf beyond the nature of his Being; either to become a Deity, by being above <U+017F>uffering, or to deba<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf into a Stock or Stone, by pretending not to feel it. To find in our<U+017F>elves the Weakne<U+017F><U+017F>es and Imperfections of our wretched Kind, is <U+017F>urely the mo<U+017F>t rea<U+017F>onable <U+017F>tep we can make towards the Compa<U+017F><U+017F>ion of our fellow Creatures. I cou'd give Examples of this kind in the <U+017F>econd <hi>Atticus.</hi> In every turn of State, without meddling on either <U+017F>ide, he has always been favorable and a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting to oppre<U+017F>t Merit. The Prai<U+017F>es which were given by a great Poet to the late Queen Mother on her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building <hi>Somer<U+017F>et Palace,</hi> one part of which was fronting to the mean Hou<U+017F>es on the other <U+017F>ide of the Water, are as ju<U+017F>tly his:

                  <l>For, the di<U+017F>tre<U+017F>t, and the afflicted lye</l>
                  <l>Mo<U+017F>t in his Thoughts, and always in his Eye.</l>
               </q>
Neither has he <U+017F>o far forgotten a poor Inhabitant of his Suburbs, who<U+017F>e be<U+017F>t pro<U+017F>pect is on the Garden of <hi>Leice<U+017F>ter-Hou<U+017F>e;</hi> but that more than once he has been offering him his Patronage, to reconcile him to a World, of which his Misfortunes have made him weary. There is another <hi>Sidney</hi> <U+017F>till remaining, tho there can never be another <hi>Spencer</hi> to de<U+017F>erve the Favor. But one <hi>Sidney</hi> gave his Patronage to the applications of a Poet; the other offer'd it unask'd. Thus, whether as a <U+017F>econd <hi>Atticus,</hi> or a <U+017F>econd Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> the latter, in all re<U+017F>pects, will not have the wor<U+017F>e of the compari<U+017F>on; and if he will take up with the <U+017F>econd place, the World will not <U+017F>o far flatter his Mode<U+017F>ty, as to <U+017F>eat him there, unle<U+017F>s it be out of a deference of Manners, that he may place him<U+017F>elf where he plea<U+017F>es at his own Table.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59875:4"/>I may therefore <U+017F>afely conclude, that he, who by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent of all men, bears <U+017F>o eminent a Character, will out of his inborn Noblene<U+017F>s, forgive the Pre<U+017F>umption of this Addre<U+017F>s.

            <p>WHether it happen'd through a long di<U+017F>u<U+017F>e of Writing, that I forgot the u<U+017F>ual compa<U+017F>s of a Play; or that by crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, with Characters and Incidents, I put a nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity upon my <U+017F>elf of lenghthning the main Action, I know not; but the fir<U+017F>t days Audience <U+017F>ufficiently convinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d me of my error; and that the Poem was in<U+017F>upportably too long. 'Tis an ill ambition of us Poets, to plea<U+017F>e an Audience with more than they can bear: And, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ing that we wrote as well, as vainly we imagin our <U+017F>elves to write; yet we ought to con<U+017F>ider, that no man can bear to be long tickled. There is a nau<U+017F>eou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s in a City fea<U+017F>t when we are to <U+017F>it four hours after we are cloy'd. I am, therefore, in the fir<U+017F>t place, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg with all manner of gratitude, their civility; who were pleas'd to endure it with <U+017F>o much patience, to be weary with <U+017F>o much good nature and <U+017F>ilence, and not to explode an entertainment, which was de<U+017F>ign'd to plea<U+017F>e them; or di<U+017F>courage an Author, who<U+017F>e misfortunes have once more brought him again<U+017F>t his will, upon the Stage. While I continue in the<U+017F>e bad circum<U+017F>tances, (and truly I <U+017F>ee very little probability of coming out:) I mu<U+017F>t be oblig'd to write, and if I may <U+017F>till hope for the <U+017F>ame kind u<U+017F>age, I <U+017F>hall the le<U+017F>s repent of that hard nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity. I write not this out of any expectation to be pityed; for I have Enemies enow to wi<U+017F>h me yet in a wor<U+017F>e condition; but give me leave to <U+017F>ay, that if I can plea<U+017F>e by writing, as I <U+017F>hall endeavour it, the Town may be <U+017F>omewhat oblig'd to my misfortunes, for a part of their diver<U+017F>ion. Having been longer acquainted with the Stage, than any Poet now living, and having ob<U+017F>erv'd how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult it was to plea<U+017F>e; that the humours of Comedy were almo<U+017F>t <U+017F>pent, that Love and Honour (the mi<U+017F>taken Topicks of Tragedy) were quite worn out, that the Theaters cou'd not <U+017F>upport their charges, that the Audience for<U+017F>ook them, that young men without Learning <U+017F>et up for Judges, and that they talk'd loude<U+017F>t, who under<U+017F>tood the lea<U+017F>t: all the<U+017F>e di<U+017F>couragements had not only wean'd me from the Stage, but had al<U+017F>o given me a loathing of it. But enough of this: the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb facs="tcp:59875:5"/>
continue; they increa<U+017F>e, and I am <U+017F>till condemn'd to dig in tho<U+017F>e exhau<U+017F>ted Mines. Whatever fault I next commit, re<U+017F>t a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd it <U+017F>hall not be that of too much length: Above twelve hunder'd lines have been cut off from this Tragedy, <U+017F>ince it was fir<U+017F>t deliver'd to the Actors. They were indeed <U+017F>o judiciou<U+017F>ly lopt by Mr. <hi>Betterton,</hi> to who<U+017F>e care and excellent action, I am equally oblig'd, that the connexion of the <U+017F>tory was not lo<U+017F>t; but on the other <U+017F>ide, it was impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to prevent <U+017F>ome part of the action from being precipitated, and coming on without that due preparation, which is requir'd to all great events: as in particular, that of rai<U+017F>ing the Mobile, in the beginning of the Fourth Act; which a Man of <hi>Benducar</hi>'s cool Character, cou'd not naturally attempt, without taking all tho<U+017F>e pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, which he fore<U+017F>aw wou'd be nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary to render his de<U+017F>ign <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sful. On this con<U+017F>ideration, I have replac'd tho<U+017F>e lines, through the whole Poem; and thereby re<U+017F>tor'd it, to that clearne<U+017F>s of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and (if I may dare to <U+017F>ay it) that lu<U+017F>tre, and ma<U+017F>culine vigour, in which it was fir<U+017F>t written. 'Tis obvious to every under<U+017F>tanding Reader, that the mo<U+017F>t poetical parts, which are De<U+017F>criptions, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Similitudes, and Moral Sentences; are tho<U+017F>e, which of nece<U+017F><U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were to be par'd away, when the body was <U+017F>woln into too large a bulk for the repre<U+017F>entation of the Stage. But there is a va<U+017F>t diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a publick entertainment on the Theatre, and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reading in the Clo<U+017F>et: In the fir<U+017F>t we are confin'd to time, and though we talk not by the hour-gla<U+017F>s, yet the Watch often drawn out of the pocket, warns the Actors, that their Audience is weary; in the la<U+017F>t, every Reader is judge of his own convenience; he can take up the book, and lay it down at his plea<U+017F>ure; and find out tho<U+017F>e beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of propriety, in thought and writing, which e<U+017F>cap'd him in the tumult and hurry of repre<U+017F>enting. And I dare boldly promi<U+017F>e for this Play, that in the roughne<U+017F>s of the numbers and cadences, (which I a<U+017F><U+017F>ure was not ca<U+017F>ual, but <U+017F>o de<U+017F>ign'd) you will <U+017F>ee <U+017F>omewhat more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>terly ari<U+017F>ing to your view, than in mo<U+017F>t, if not any of my former Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies. There is a more noble daring in the Figures and more <U+017F>uit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the lo<U+017F>tine<U+017F>s of the Subject; and be<U+017F>ides this <U+017F>ome newne<U+017F><U+017F>es of <hi>Engli<U+017F>h,</hi> tran<U+017F>lated from the Beauties of Modern Tongues, as well as from the elegancies of the Latin; and here and there <U+017F>ome old words are <U+017F>prinkled, which for their <U+017F>ignificance and <U+017F>ound, de<U+017F>erv'd not to be antiquated; <U+017F>uch as we often find in Salu<U+017F>t among<U+017F>t the
<pb facs="tcp:59875:6"/>
Roman Authors, and in <hi>Milton</hi>'s Paradi<U+017F>e among<U+017F>t ours; though perhaps the latter in<U+017F>tead of <U+017F>prinkling, has dealt them with too free a hand, even <U+017F>ometimes to the ob<U+017F>curing of his <U+017F>en<U+017F>e.</p>
            <p>As for the <U+017F>tory or plot of the Tragedy, 'tis purely fiction; for I take it up where the Hi<U+017F>tory has laid it down. We are a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd by all Writers of tho<U+017F>e times, that <hi>Seba<U+017F>tian</hi> a young Prince of great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and expectation, undertook that War partly upon a religious account, partly at the <U+017F>ollicitation of <hi>Muley-Mahumet,</hi> who had been driven out of his Dominions, by <hi>Abdelmelech,</hi> or as others call him <hi>Muley-Moluch</hi> his nigh Kin<U+017F>man, who de<U+017F>cended from the <U+017F>ame Family of the <hi>Xeriff</hi>'s; who<U+017F>e Fathers <hi>Hamet</hi> and <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> had conquer'd that Empire with joint Forces; and <U+017F>har'd it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them after their victory: That the body of <hi>Don Seba<U+017F>tian</hi> was never found in the Field of Battel; which gave occa<U+017F>ion for many to believe, that he was not <U+017F>lain; that <U+017F>ome years after, when the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> with a pretended title, by force of Arms had <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g><U+017F>urp'd the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> from the Hou<U+017F>e of <hi>Braganza,</hi> a certain Per<U+017F>on who call'd him<U+017F>elf <hi>Don Seba<U+017F>tian,</hi> and had all the marks of his body and features of his face, appear'd at <hi>Venice,</hi> where he was own'd by <U+017F>ome of his Country-men; but being <U+017F>eiz'd by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was fir<U+017F>t Impri<U+017F>on'd, then <U+017F>ent to the Gallies, and at la<U+017F>t put to Death in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. 'Tis mo<U+017F>t certain, that the <hi>Portugue<U+017F>es</hi> expected his return for almo<U+017F>t an Age together after that Battel; which is at lea<U+017F>t a proof of their extream love to his Memory; and the u<U+017F>age which they had from their new Conquerors, might po<U+017F><U+017F>ibly make them <U+017F>o extravagant in their hopes and wi<U+017F>hes for their old Ma<U+017F>ter.</p>
            <p>This ground work the Hi<U+017F>tory afforded me, and I de<U+017F>ire no better to build a Play upon it: For where the event of a great action is left doubtful, there the Poet is left Ma<U+017F>ter: He may rai<U+017F>e what he plea<U+017F>es on that foundation, provided he makes it of a piece, and according to the rule of probability. From hence I was only oblig'd, that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<U+017F>tian</hi> <U+017F>hou'd return to <hi>Portugal</hi> no more; but at the <U+017F>ame time I had him at my own di<U+017F>po<U+017F>al, whether to be<U+017F>tow him in <hi>Affrick,</hi> or in any other corner of the World, or to have elos'd the Tragedy with his death; and the la<U+017F>t of the<U+017F>e was certainly the mo<U+017F>t ea<U+017F>ie, but for the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on, the lea<U+017F>t artful; becau<U+017F>e as I have <U+017F>omewhere <U+017F>aid, the poy<U+017F>on and the dagger are <U+017F>till at hand, to butcher a Heroe, when a Poet wants the brains to <U+017F>ave him. It being therefore only nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary
<pb facs="tcp:59875:6"/>
according to the Laws of the <hi>Drama,</hi> that <hi>Seba<U+017F>tian</hi> <U+017F>hou'd no more be <U+017F>een vpon the Throne, I leave it for the World to judge, whether or no I have di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed of him according to art, or have bungled up the conclu<U+017F>ion of his adventure. In the drawing of his character I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got not piety, which any one may ob<U+017F>erve to be one principal ingredient of it; even <U+017F>o far as to be a habit in him; though I <U+017F>how him once to be tran<U+017F>ported from it by the violence of a <U+017F>udden pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor a <U+017F>elf murther. This being pre<U+017F>uppos'd, that he was Religious, the horror of his ince<U+017F>t, tho innocently committed, was the be<U+017F>t rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on which the Stage cou'd give for hind'ring his return. 'Tis true I have no right to bla<U+017F>t his Memory, with <U+017F>uch a crime: but declaring it to be fiction, I de<U+017F>ire my Audience to think it no longer true, than while they are <U+017F>eeing it repre<U+017F>ented: For that once ended, he may be a Saint for ought I know; and we have rea<U+017F>on to pre<U+017F>ume he is. On this <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ition, it was unrea<U+017F>onable to have kill'd him; for the Learned Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> has well ob<U+017F>erv'd, that in all puni<U+017F>hments we are to regulate our <U+017F>elves by Poetical ju<U+017F>tice; and according to tho<U+017F>e mea<U+017F>ures an involuntary <U+017F>in de<U+017F>erves not death; from whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that to divorce him<U+017F>elf from the beloved object, to retire into a de<U+017F>art, and deprive him<U+017F>elf of a Throne, was the utmo<U+017F>t puni<U+017F>hment, which a Poet cou'd inflict, as it was al<U+017F>o the utmo<U+017F>t reparation, which <hi>Seba<U+017F>tian</hi> cou'd make. For what relates to <hi>Almeyda,</hi> her part is wholly fictitious: I know it is the <U+017F>urname of a noble Family in <hi>Portugal,</hi> which was very in<U+017F>trumental in the Re<U+017F>toration of <hi>Don John de Braganza,</hi> Father to the mo<U+017F>t Illu<U+017F>trious and mo<U+017F>t Pious Prince<U+017F>s our Queen <hi>Dowager.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Author of a Novel, call'd <hi>Don Seba<U+017F>tian,</hi> has given that name to an <hi>Affrican</hi> Lady of his own invention, and makes her Si<U+017F>ter to <hi>Muley-Mahumet.</hi> But I have wholly chang'd the accidents, and borrow'd nothing but the <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>ition, that <U+017F>he was belov'd by the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> Tho, if I had taken the whole <U+017F>tory, and wrought it up into a Play, I might have done it exactly according to the practice of almo<U+017F>t all the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; who were never accus'd of being Plagiaries, for building their Tragedies on known Fables. Thus <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus Cae<U+017F>ar</hi> wrote an <hi>Ajax,</hi> which was not the le<U+017F>s his own, becau<U+017F>e <hi>Euripides</hi> had written a Play before him on that Subject. Thus of late years <hi>Corneille</hi> writ an <hi>Oedipus</hi> after <hi>Sophocles;</hi> and I have de<U+017F>ign'd one after him, which I wrote with Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> yet neither the <hi>French</hi> Poet <U+017F>tole from the
<pb facs="tcp:59875:7"/>
               <hi>Greek,</hi> nor we from the <hi>French man.</hi> 'Tis the contrivance, the new turn, and new characters, which alter the property and make it ours. The <hi>Materia Poetica</hi> is as common to all Writers, as the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> to all Phy<U+017F>icians. Thus in our <hi>Chronicles, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> Hi<U+017F>tory is <U+017F>till his own, though <hi>Matthew Paris, Stow</hi> and <hi>Holling<U+017F>hed</hi> writ before him, otherwi<U+017F>e we mu<U+017F>t have been content with their dull relations, if a better Pen had not been allow'd to come after them, and write his own account after a new and better manner.</p>
            <p>I mu<U+017F>t farther declare freely, that I have not exactly kept to the three Mechanick rules of unity: I knew them and had them in my eye, but follow'd them only at a di<U+017F>tance; for the Genius of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli<U+017F>h</hi> cannot bear too regular a Play; we are given to variety, even to a debauchery of Plea<U+017F>ure. My Scenes are therefore <U+017F>ometimes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, becau<U+017F>e my <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>nder-plot requir'd them <U+017F>o to be; though the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Scene remains of the <U+017F>ame Ca<U+017F>tle, and I have taken the time of two days, becau<U+017F>e the variety of accidents, which are here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ented, cou'd not naturally be <U+017F>uppos'd to arrive in one: But to gain a greater Beauty, 'tis lawful for a Poet to <U+017F>uper<U+017F>ede a le<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>I mu<U+017F>t likewi<U+017F>e own, that I have <U+017F>omewhat deviated from the known Hi<U+017F>tory, in the death of <hi>Muley-Moluch,</hi> who, by all relations dyed of a feaver in the Battel, before his Army had wholly won the Field; but if I have allow'd him another day of life, it was becau<U+017F>e I <U+017F>tood in need of <U+017F>o <U+017F>hining a Character of brutality, as I have given him; which is indeed the <U+017F>ame, with that of the pre<U+017F>ent Emperor <hi>Muley I<U+017F>hmael,</hi> as <U+017F>ome of our <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Officers, who have been in his Court, have credibly inform'd me.</p>
            <p>I have been li<U+017F>tning what objections had been made, again<U+017F>t the conduct of the Play, but found them all <U+017F>o trivial, that if I <U+017F>hou'd name them, a true critick wou'd imagin that I play'd booty, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rais'd up fantoms for my <U+017F>elf to conquer. Some are pleas'd to <U+017F>ay the Writing is dull; but <hi>aetatem habet de <U+017F>e loquatur.</hi> Others that the double poy<U+017F>on is unnatural; let the common received opinion, and <hi>Au<U+017F>onius</hi> his famous Epigram an<U+017F>wer that. La<U+017F>tly a more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant <U+017F>ort of Creatures than either of the former, maintain that the Character of <hi>Dorax,</hi> is not only unnatural, but incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tent with it <U+017F>elf; let them read the Play and think again, and if yet they are not <U+017F>atisfied, ca<U+017F>t their eyes on that Chapter of the Wi<U+017F>e
<pb facs="tcp:59875:7"/>
               <hi>Montaigne,</hi> which is intituled <hi>de l' Incon<U+017F>tance des actions hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines.</hi> A longer reply, is what tho<U+017F>e Cavillers de<U+017F>erve not; but I will give them and their fellows to under<U+017F>tand, that the Earl of <hi>Dor<U+017F>et,</hi> was pleas'd to read the Tragedy twice over before it was Acted; and did me the favour to <U+017F>end me word, that I had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beyond any of my former Plays; and that he was di<U+017F>pleas'd any thing <U+017F>hou'd be cut away. If I have not rea<U+017F>on to prefer his <U+017F>ingle judgment to a whole Faction, let the World be judge; for the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition is the <U+017F>ame with that of <hi>Lucan's</hi> Heroe again<U+017F>t an Army; <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currere bellum, atque virum.</hi> I think I may mode<U+017F>tly conclude, that whatever errors there may be, either in the de<U+017F>ign, or writing of this Play, they are not tho<U+017F>e which have been objected to it. I think al<U+017F>o, that I am not yet arriv'd to the Age of doating; and that I have given <U+017F>o much application to this Poem, that I cou'd not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably let it run into many gro<U+017F>s ab<U+017F>urdities; which may caution my Enemies from too ra<U+017F>h a cen<U+017F>ure; and may al<U+017F>o encourage my friends, who are many more than I cou'd rea<U+017F>onably have expected, to believe their kindne<U+017F>s has not been very unde<U+017F>ervedly be<U+017F>towed on me. This is not a Play that was huddled up in ha<U+017F>t; and to <U+017F>hew it was not, I will own, that be<U+017F>ide the general Moral of it, which is given in the four la<U+017F>t lines, there is al<U+017F>o another Moral, couch'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every one of the principal Parts and Characters, which a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Critick will ob<U+017F>erve, though I point not to it in this Preface. And there may be al<U+017F>o <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ecret Beauties in the decorum of parts, and uniformity of de<U+017F>ign, which my puny judges will not ea<U+017F>ily find out; let them con<U+017F>ider in the la<U+017F>t Scene of the fourth Act, whether I have not pre<U+017F>erv'd the rule of decency, in giving all the advantage to the Royal Character; and in making <hi>Dorax</hi> fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ubmit: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too they may have thought, that it was through indigence of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, that I have given the <U+017F>ame to <hi>Seba<U+017F>tian</hi> and <hi>Almeyda;</hi> and con<U+017F>equently made them alike in all things but their Sex. But let them look a little deeper into the matter, and they will find that this identity of Character in the greatne<U+017F>s of their Souls; was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a preparation of the final di<U+017F>covery, and that the likene<U+017F>s of their nature, was a fair hint to the proximity of their blood.</p>
            <p>To avoid the imputation of too much vanity (for all Writers, and e<U+017F>pecially Poets will have <U+017F>ome) I will give but one other in<U+017F>tance, in relation to the <g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>niformity of the de<U+017F>ign. I have ob<U+017F>erv'd that
<pb facs="tcp:59875:8"/>
the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> will not bear a thorough Tragedy; but are pleas'd, that it <U+017F>hou'd be lightned with underparts of mirth. It had been ea<U+017F>ie for me to have given my Audience a better cour<U+017F>e of Comedy, I mean a more diverting, than that of <hi>Antonio</hi> and <hi>Morayma.</hi> But I dare appeal even to my Enemies, if I or any man cou'd have invented one, which had been more of a piece, and more depending, on the <U+017F>erious part of the de<U+017F>ign. For what cou'd be more uniform, than to draw from out of the members of a Captive Court, the Subject of a Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal entertainment? To prepare this Epi<U+017F>ode, you <U+017F>ee <hi>Dorax</hi> giving the Character of <hi>Antonio,</hi> in the beginning of the Play, upon his fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>ight of him at the Lottery; and to make the dependence, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi> is ingag'd in the Fourth Act, for the deliverance of <hi>Almey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi> which is al<U+017F>o prepar'd, by his being fir<U+017F>t made a Slave to the Captain of the Rabble.</p>
            <p>I <U+017F>hou'd beg pardon for the<U+017F>e in<U+017F>tances; but perhaps they may be of u<U+017F>e to future Poets, in the conduct of their Plays: At lea<U+017F>t if I appear too po<U+017F>itive; I am growing old, and thereby, in po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of <U+017F>ome experience, which men in years will always a<U+017F><U+017F>ume for a right of talking. Certainly, if a Man can ever have rea<U+017F>on to <U+017F>et a value on him<U+017F>elf, 'tis when his ungenerous Enemies are taking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Times upon him, to ruin him in his reputation. And therefore for once, I will make bold to take the Coun<U+017F>el of my Old Ma<U+017F>ter <hi>Virgil.</hi>

No more Emba<U+017F><U+017F>ies to that lu<U+017F>ty young Stallion of a Gardiner. Next my habit of a Slave; I have made my <U+017F>elf as like him as I can, all but his youth and vigor; which when I had, I pa<U+017F>s'd my time as well as any of my Holy Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ors. Now walking under the Windows of my Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, if <hi>Johayma</hi> look out, <U+017F>he will certainly take me for <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> and call to me; and by that I <U+017F>hall know what Concupi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is working in her; <U+017F>he cannot come down to commit Iniquity, there's my <U+017F>afety; but if <U+017F>he peep, if <U+017F>he put her No<U+017F>e abroad, there's demon<U+017F>tration of her pious Will: And I'll not make the fir<U+017F>t precedent for a Church-man to forgive Injuries.</p>
