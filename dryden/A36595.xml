            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>To the Honourable Sir <hi>WILLIAM LEVISON GOWER,</hi> Bar.</head>
                  <p>THere is one kind of Vertue, which is inborn in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and indeed in mo<U+017F>t of the Ancient Families of this Nation; they are not apt to in<U+017F>ult on the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of their Countrymen. But you, Sir, I may tell it you without Flattery, have grafted on this natural Commi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eration, and rais'd it to a Nobler Vertue: As you have been pleas'd to honour me, for a long time, with <U+017F>ome part of your E<U+017F>teem and your good Will; <U+017F>o in particular, <U+017F>ince the late Revolution, you have increas'd the Proofs of your kindne<U+017F>s to me; and not <U+017F>uffer'd the difference of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which produce <U+017F>uch Hatred and Enmity in the brutal Part of Human kind, to remove you from the <U+017F>ettled Ba<U+017F>is of your good Nature and good Sence. This Noblene<U+017F>s of yours, had it been exercis'd on an Enemy, had certainly been a Point of Honour, and as <U+017F>uch I might have ju<U+017F>tly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended it to the World: But that of con<U+017F>tancy to your former Choice, and the pur<U+017F>uance of your fir<U+017F>t Favours, are Vertues not overcommon among<U+017F>t <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Men. All things of Honour have, at be<U+017F>t, <U+017F>omewhat of O<U+017F>tentation in them, and Self-love; there is a Pride of doing more than is expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from us, and more than others would have done. But to proceed in the <U+017F>ame Tract of Goodne<U+017F>s, Favour, and Protection, is to <U+017F>hew that a Man is acted by a thorough Principle: It carries <U+017F>omewhat of Tenderne<U+017F>s in it, which is Humanity in a Heroical Degree; 'tis a kind of unmoveable good Nature; a word which is commonly De<U+017F>pis'd, becau<U+017F>e it is <U+017F>o <U+017F>eldom Practis'd. But after all, 'tis the mo<U+017F>t gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Vertue, oppos'd to the mo<U+017F>t degenerate Vice, which is
<pb facs="tcp:96109:3"/>
that of Ruggedne<U+017F>s and Har<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s to our Fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>'Tis upon this knowledge of you, Sir, that I have cho<U+017F>en you, with your permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion, to be the Patron of this Poem. And, as <U+017F>ince this wonderful Revolution, I have begun with the be<U+017F>t Pattern of Humanity, the Earl of <hi>Leice<U+017F>ter;</hi> I <U+017F>hall continue to follow the <U+017F>ame Method, in all, to whom I <U+017F>hall Addre<U+017F>s; and endeavour to pitch on <U+017F>uch only, as have been pleas'd to own me in this Ruin of my <U+017F>mall Fortune; who, though they are of a contrary Opinion them<U+017F>elves, yet blame not me for adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to a lo<U+017F>t Cau<U+017F>e; and judging for my <U+017F>elf, what I cannot chu<U+017F>e but judge; <U+017F>o long as I am a patient Sufferer, and no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>turber of the Government. Which, if it be a <U+017F>evere Penance, as a great Wit has told the World, 'tis at lea<U+017F>t enjoyn'd me by my <U+017F>elf: And <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> as much a Fool as I, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd to di<U+017F>cipline his Body, no farther than he found he could endure the <U+017F>mart.</p>
                  <p>You <U+017F>ee, Sir, I am not entertaining you, like <hi>Ovid,</hi> with a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Epi<U+017F>tle from <hi>Pontus;</hi> I <U+017F>uffer no more, than I can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ily undergo; and <U+017F>o long as I enjoy my Liberty, which is the Birth-right of an <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Man, the re<U+017F>t <U+017F>hall never go near my Heart. The Merry Philo<U+017F>opher, is more to my Humour than the Melancholick; and I find no di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition in my <U+017F>elf to Cry, while the mad World is daily <U+017F>upplying me with <U+017F>uch Occa<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Laughter. The more rea<U+017F>onable <U+017F>ort of my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, have <U+017F>hewn <U+017F>o much favour to this Piece, that they give me no doubt of their Protection for the future.</p>
                  <p>As you, Sir, have been pleas'd to follow the Example of their Goodne<U+017F>s, in favouring me: So give me leave to <U+017F>ay, that I follow yours in this Dedication, to a Per<U+017F>on of a different Per<U+017F>wa<U+017F>ion. Though I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s withal, that I have had a former Encouragement from you for this Addre<U+017F>s<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> and the warm Remembrance of your noble Ho<U+017F>pitality to me at
<pb facs="tcp:96109:3"/>
                     <hi>Trentham,</hi> when <U+017F>ome years a go I vi<U+017F>ited my Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in your Country, has ever <U+017F>ince given me a violent Temptation to this boldne<U+017F>s.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, were this Comedy wholly mine, I <U+017F>hould call it a Trifle, and perhaps not think it worth your Patronage; but when the Names of <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Moliere</hi> are joyn'd in it; that is, the two greate<U+017F>t Names of Ancient and Modern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, I mu<U+017F>t not pre<U+017F>ume <U+017F>o far on their Reputation, to think their be<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t unque<U+017F>tion'd Productions can be term'd Little. I will not give you the trouble, of acquainting you what I have added, or alter'd in either of them, <U+017F>o much it may be for the wor<U+017F>e; but only that the difference of our Stage from the <hi>Roman</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> did <U+017F>o require it. But I am affraid, for my own Intere<U+017F>t, the World will too ea<U+017F>ily di<U+017F>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that more than half of it is mine; and that the re<U+017F>t is rather a lame Imitation of their Excellencies, than a ju<U+017F>t Tran<U+017F>lation. 'Tis enough, that the Reader know by you, that I neither de<U+017F>erve nor de<U+017F>ire any Applau<U+017F>e from it: If I have perform'd any thing, 'tis the Genius of my Authors that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pir'd me; and if it has pleas'd in Repre<U+017F>entation, let the Actors <U+017F>hare the Prai<U+017F>e among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves. As for <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Moliere,</hi> they are dangerous People; and I am too weak a Game<U+017F>ter to put my <U+017F>elf into their Form of Play. But what has been wanting on my Part, has been abundantly <U+017F>upplyed by the Excellent Compo<U+017F>ition of Mr. <hi>Purcell;</hi> in who<U+017F>e Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on we have at length found an <hi>Engli<U+017F>h-man,</hi> equal with the be<U+017F>t abroad. At lea<U+017F>t my Opinion of him has been <U+017F>uch, <U+017F>ince his happy and judicious Performances in the late <hi>Opera;</hi> and the Experience I have had of him, in the <U+017F>etting my Three Songs for this <hi>Amphitryon:</hi> To all which, and particularly to the Compo<U+017F>ition of the <hi>Pa<U+017F>toral Dialogue,</hi> the numerous Quire of Fair Ladies gave <U+017F>o ju<U+017F>t an Applau<U+017F>e on the Third Day. I am only <U+017F>orry, for my own <U+017F>ake, that there was one

Star wanting, as Beautiful as any in our Hemi<U+017F>phere; that young <hi>Berenice,</hi> who is mi<U+017F>imploying all her Charms on <U+017F>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Country Souls, that can never know the Value of them; and lo<U+017F>ing the Triumphs, which are ready prepar'd for her in the Court and Town. And yet I know not whether I am <U+017F>o much a lo<U+017F>er by her ab<U+017F>ence; for I have Rea<U+017F>on to apprehend the <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of her Judgment, if it were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd with the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s of her Nature; and after all, I fear <U+017F>he may come time enough, to di<U+017F>cover a Thou<U+017F>and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in my Play, which might have pa<U+017F>s'd on Vulgar Under<U+017F>tandings. Be pleas'd to u<U+017F>e the Authority of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over her, on my behalf; enjoyn her to keep her own Thoughts of <hi>Amphitryon</hi> to her <U+017F>elf; or at lea<U+017F>t not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him too <U+017F>trictly with <hi>Moliere</hi>'s. 'Tis true, I have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>t in this Partiality of hers; but withal, I plead <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ort of Merit for it, in being <U+017F>o Particularly as I am,</p>

                  <l>Forgets his Golden Work, and turns a Drone:</l>
                  <l>Such is a Satyr, when you take away</l>
                  <l>That Rage, in which his Noble Vigour lay.</l>
                  <l>What gain you, by not <U+017F>uffering him to teize ye?</l>
                  <l>He neither can offend you, now, nor plea<U+017F>e ye.</l>
                  <l>The Honey-bag, and Venome, lay <U+017F>o near,</l>

                  <l>To box, like Boys, with one Hand ty'd behind him?</l>
                  <l>This is plain levelling of Wit; in which</l>
                  <l>The Poor has all th' advantage, not the Rich.</l>

                  <l>Still <hi>Julian</hi>'s interloping Trade goes on:</l>
                  <l>Though Satyr on the Theatre you <U+017F>mother,</l>
                  <l>Yet in Lampoons, you Libel one another.</l>

                  <l>You whip 'em out, like School-boys, till they gig:</l>
                  <l>And, with the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, we Readers gue<U+017F>s;</l>
                  <l>For, ev'ry one, <U+017F>till dwindles to a le<U+017F>s.</l>
                  <l>And much good Malice, is <U+017F>o meanly dre<U+017F>t,</l>
