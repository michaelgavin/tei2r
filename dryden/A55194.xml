            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>L<g ref="char:V"><U+01B2></g>cretius,</hi> endeavouring to prove from the principles of his Philo<U+017F>ophy, that the world had a ca<U+017F>ual beginning from the concour<U+017F>e of <hi>Atomes;</hi> and that Men, as well as the re<U+017F>t of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, were produc'd from the vital heat and moi<U+017F>ture of their Mother Earth; from the <U+017F>ame principles is
<pb facs="tcp:47090:4"/>
bound to an<U+017F>wer this objection, why Men are not daily form'd after the <U+017F>ame manner, which he tells us is, becau<U+017F>e the kindly warmth, and procreative faculty of the ground is now worn out: The Sun is a di<U+017F>abled Lover, and the Earth is pa<U+017F>t her teeming time.</p>
            <p>Though Religion has inform'd us better of our Origine, yet it appears plainly, that not only the Bodies, but the Souls of Men, have decreas'd from the vigour of the fir<U+017F>t Ages; that we are not more <U+017F>hort of the <U+017F>tature and <U+017F>trength of tho<U+017F>e gygantick Heroes, than we are of their under<U+017F>tanding, and their wit. To let pa<U+017F>s tho<U+017F>e happy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, who were <U+017F>triplings at four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>core, and had afterwards <U+017F>even or eight hundred years before them to beget Sons and Daughters; and to con<U+017F>ider Man in reference only to his mind, and that no higher
<pb facs="tcp:47090:4"/>
than the Age of <hi>Socrates:</hi> How va<U+017F>t a difference is there betwixt the productions of tho<U+017F>e Souls, and the<U+017F>e of ours? How much better <hi>Plato, Ari<U+017F>totle,</hi> and the re<U+017F>t of the Philo<U+017F>ophers under<U+017F>tood nature; <hi>Thucydides,</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> adorn'd Hi<U+017F>tory; <hi>Sophocles, Eurypides</hi> and <hi>Menander</hi> advanc'd Poetry, than tho<U+017F>e Dwarfs of Wit and Learning who <U+017F>ucceeded them in after times? That Age was mo<U+017F>t Famous among<U+017F>t the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which ended with the death of <hi>Alexander;</hi> among<U+017F>t the <hi>Romans</hi> Learning <U+017F>eem'd again to revive and flouri<U+017F>h in the Century which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd <hi>Cicero, Varro, Salu<U+017F>t, Livy, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi> and <hi>Virgil:</hi> And after a <U+017F>hort interval of years, (wherein Nature <U+017F>eem'd to take a breathing time for a <U+017F>econd birth,) there <U+017F>prung up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Ve<U+017F>pa<U+017F>ians,</hi> and tho<U+017F>e excellent Princes who <U+017F>ucceeded them, a race of memorable Wits; <U+017F>uch as were
<pb facs="tcp:47090:5"/>
the two <hi>Plinies, Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius;</hi> and as if <hi>Greece</hi> was emulous of the <hi>Roman</hi> learning, under the <U+017F>ame favourable Con<U+017F>tellation, was born the famous Philo<U+017F>opher and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>torian <hi>Plutarch.</hi> Then whom An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity has never produc'd a Man more generally knowing, or more vertuous; and no <U+017F>ucceeding Age has equall'd him. His Lives both in his own e<U+017F>teem, and that of others, accounted the Noble<U+017F>t of his Works, have been long <U+017F>ince ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd into <hi>Engli<U+017F>h:</hi> But as that Tran<U+017F>lation was only from the <hi>French,</hi> <U+017F>o it <U+017F>uffer'd this double di<U+017F>advantage, fir<U+017F>t that it was but a Copy of a Copy, and that too but lamely taken from the <hi>Greek</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal: Secondly that the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h</hi> Language was then unpoli<U+017F>h'd, and far from the perfection which it has <U+017F>ince attain'd: So that the fir<U+017F>t Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion is not only ungrammatical and
<pb facs="tcp:47090:5"/>
ungraceful, but in many places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t unintelligible. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ons, and lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>o u<U+017F>eful a piece of Hi<U+017F>tory, <U+017F>hou'd lie oppre<U+017F>s'd under the rubbi<U+017F>h of Antiquated words, <U+017F>ome ingenious and learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, have undertaken this Task: And what wou'd have been the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of one Mans Life, will, by the <U+017F>everal endeavours of many, be now accompli<U+017F>h'd in the compa<U+017F>s of a year. How far they have <U+017F>ucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this laudable attempt, to me it belongs not to determine; who am too much a party to be a Judge: But I have the honour to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<U+017F><U+017F>ion'd from the Tran<U+017F>lators of this Volum, to in<U+017F>cribe their labours and my own, with all humility, to your Graces Name and Patronage. And never was any Man more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of an employment, of which he was <U+017F>o little worthy. Fortune has at la<U+017F>t gratify'd that earne<U+017F>t
<pb facs="tcp:47090:6"/>
de<U+017F>ire I have always had, to <U+017F>hew my devotion to your Grace; though I de<U+017F>pair of paying you my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments. And of all other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities I have happen'd on the mo<U+017F>t favourable to my <U+017F>elf; who, having never been able to produce any thing of my own, which cou'd be worthy of your view, am <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tance of my friends, and honour'd with the pre<U+017F>entation of their labours. The Author they have Tran<U+017F>lated, has been long familiar to you: Who have been conver<U+017F>ant in all <U+017F>orts of Hi<U+017F>tory both Ancient and Modern; and have form'd the Idea of your mo<U+017F>t Noble Life from the in<U+017F>tructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Examples contain'd in them; both in the management of publick affairs, and in the private Offices of vertue; in the enjoyment of your better fortune, and <U+017F>u<U+017F>taining of your wor<U+017F>e; in habituating your <U+017F>elf
<pb facs="tcp:47090:6"/>
to an ea<U+017F>ie greatne<U+017F>s; in repelling your Enemies, in <U+017F>uccouring your Friends, and in all traver<U+017F>es of fortune, in every colour of your Life, maintaining an inviolable fidelity to your Soveraign. Tis long <U+017F>ince that I have learn'd to forget the art of prai<U+017F>ing; but here the heart dictates to the pen; and I appeal to your Enemies, (if <U+017F>o much genero<U+017F>ity and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can have left you any) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are not con<U+017F>cious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves that I have not flatter'd.</p>
            <p>Tis an Age indeed, which is only fit for Satyr; and the <U+017F>harpe<U+017F>t I have <U+017F>hall never be wanting to launce its Villanies, and its ingratitude to the Government: There are few Men in it, who are capable of <U+017F>upporting the weight of a ju<U+017F>t and de<U+017F>erv'd commendation: But among<U+017F>t tho<U+017F>e few there mu<U+017F>t always <U+017F>tand excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Illu<U+017F>trious Names of <hi>Ormond</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:47090:7"/>
and of <hi>O<U+017F><U+017F>ory:</hi> A Father and a Son, only Worthy of each other. Never was one Soul more fully infus'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to anothers brea<U+017F>t: Never was <U+017F>o <U+017F>trong an impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion made of vertue, as that of your Graces into him: But though the <U+017F>tamp was deep, the <U+017F>ubject which receiv'd it was of too fine a compo<U+017F>ition to be dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Were not priority of time and nature in the ca<U+017F>e, it might have been doubted which of you had been mo<U+017F>t excellent: But Heaven <U+017F>natch'd away the Copy to make the Original more precious. I dare tru<U+017F>t my <U+017F>elf no farther on this <U+017F>ubject; for after years of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, my <U+017F>orrow is yet <U+017F>o green upon me, that I am ready to tax Providence for the lo<U+017F>s of that Heroick Son: Three Nations had a general concernment in his Death, but I had one <U+017F>o very particular, that all my hopes are almo<U+017F>t dead with
<pb facs="tcp:47090:7"/>
him; and I have lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>o much that I am pa<U+017F>t the danger of a <U+017F>econd Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck. But he <U+017F>leeps with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envy'd commendation: And has left your Grace the <U+017F>ad Legacy of all tho<U+017F>e Glories which he deriv'd from you. An acce<U+017F><U+017F>ion which you wanted not, who were <U+017F>o rich before in your own vertues, and that high reputation which is the product of them. A long de<U+017F>cent of Noble Ance<U+017F>tors was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<U+017F><U+017F>ary to have made you great: But Heaven threw it in as over-plus when you were born. What you have done and <U+017F>uffer'd for two Royal Ma<U+017F>ters has been enough to render you Illu<U+017F>trious; <U+017F>o that you may <U+017F>afely wave the Nobility of your birth, and relie on your actions for your fame. You have cancell'd the debt which you ow'd to your Progenitors, and reflect more brightne<U+017F>s on their memory than

Your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, which Providence gave you not leave to pre<U+017F>erve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one King, it has given you op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity under another to re<U+017F>tore. You cou'd not <U+017F>ave it from the Cha<U+017F>ti<U+017F>ement which was due to its Rebellion, but you rais'd it from ruin after its repentance: So that the Trophies of War were the portion of the Conquerour, but the Triumphs of peace were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erv'd for the vanqui<U+017F>h'd. The misfortunes of <hi>Ireland</hi> were owing to it <U+017F>elf, but its happine<U+017F>s and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>toration to your Grace. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion again<U+017F>t a Lawful Prince, was puni<U+017F>h'd by an U<U+017F>urping Tyrant: But the fruits of his Victory were the rewards of a Loyal Subject. How much that Noble Kingdom has flouri<U+017F>h'd under your Graces Government, both the Inhabitants and the Crown are <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible. The

riches of <hi>Ireland</hi> are increas'd by it, and the Revenues of <hi>England</hi> are augmented. That which was a charge and burden of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is render'd an advantage and <U+017F>upport: The Trade and Intere<U+017F>t of both Countries are united in a mutual benefit; they con<U+017F>pire to make each other happy; the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the one is an improvement of its Commerce, the preeminence of the other is not impair'd by the intercour<U+017F>e, and common nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities are <U+017F>upply'd by both. <hi>Ireland</hi> is no more a <hi>Cyon,</hi> to <U+017F>uck the nouri<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Mother Tree; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it overtop'd, or hinder'd from growth by the <U+017F>uperiour bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; but the Roots of <hi>England,</hi> diving (if I may dare to <U+017F>ay it,) underneath the Seas, ri<U+017F>e at a ju<U+017F>t di<U+017F>tance on the Neighbouring Shore; and there <U+017F>hoot up, and bear a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct <U+017F>carce inferiour to the Trunk

I may rai<U+017F>e the commendation higher, and yet not fear to offend the truth: <hi>Ireland</hi> is a better Penitent than <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> The Crime of Rebellion was common to both Countries; but the repentance of one I<U+017F>land has been <U+017F>teady; that of the other, to its <U+017F>hame, has <U+017F>uffer'd a relap<U+017F>e: Which <U+017F>hews the Conver<U+017F>ions of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to have been real, that of ours to have been but counterfeit. The Sons of Guilty Fathers there have made amends for the di<U+017F>loyalty of their Families: But here the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>cendants of pardon'd Rebels have only waited their time to copy the wickedne<U+017F>s of their Parents, and if po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to out do it: They di<U+017F>dain to hold their Patrimonies by acts of Grace and of Indempnity: and by maintaining their old Trea<U+017F>onable principles, make it apparent that they are <U+017F>till <U+017F>peculative Traytors.

For whether they are zealous Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or prophane Republicans, (of which two <U+017F>orts they are principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compos'd) both our Reformers of Church and Sate, pretend to a power <U+017F>uperiour to King<U+017F>hip. The Fanaticks derive their Authority from the Bible; and plead Religion to be antecedent to any <U+017F>ecular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation: By vertue of which Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taking it for granted that their own Wor<U+017F>hip is only true, they arrogate to them<U+017F>elves the right of di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ing the Temporal power ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their plea<U+017F>ure; as that which is <U+017F>ubordinate to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: So that the <U+017F>ame Rea<U+017F>ons, and Scriptures, which are urg'd by Popes for the depo<U+017F>ition of Princes, are produc'd by Sectaries for altering the Succe<U+017F><U+017F>ion. The Epi<U+017F>copal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation has manumiz'd Kings from the U<U+017F>urpation of <hi>Rome;</hi> for it preaches obedience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ignation

to the lawful Secular power: but the pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our Schi<U+017F>maticks, is to <U+017F>et up them<U+017F>elves in the Papal Chair; and to make their Princes only their Tru<U+017F>tees. So that whether they or the Pope were uppermo<U+017F>t in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Royal Authority were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually depre<U+017F>s'd: The Pri<U+017F>on of our Kings wou'd be the <U+017F>ame; the Gaol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers only wou'd be alter'd. The broad Republicans are generally Men of Athei<U+017F>tick principles, nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Chri<U+017F>tians, who are beholding to the Font, only that they are <U+017F>o call'd, otherwi<U+017F>e <hi>Hobbi<U+017F>ts</hi> in their politicks and Morals: Every Church is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to them that they own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves of none; becau<U+017F>e their Lives are too <U+017F>candalous for any. Some of the Sectaries are <U+017F>o proud, that they think they cannot <U+017F>in; tho<U+017F>e Common-wealth Men are <U+017F>o wicked, that they conclude there is no <U+017F>in. Lewdne<U+017F>s,

Rioting, Cheating and Debauchery, are their work a day practi<U+017F>e: Their more <U+017F>olemn crimes, are unnatural Lu<U+017F>ts, and horrid Murthers. Yet the<U+017F>e are the Patrons of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformi<U+017F>ts; the<U+017F>e are the Swords and Bucklers of Gods cau<U+017F>e; if his cau<U+017F>e be that of Separati<U+017F>ts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells. Tis not but the<U+017F>e A<U+017F><U+017F>ociates know each other at the bottom, as well as <hi>Simeon</hi> knew <hi>Levi:</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans are <U+017F>atisfy'd that the Schi<U+017F>maticks are Hypocrites, and the Schi<U+017F>maticks are a<U+017F><U+017F>ur'd that the Republicans are Athei<U+017F>ts: But their common principles of Government are the chaines that link them: For both hold Kings to be Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of their own making, and by inference to be at their own di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ing. With this difference, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<U+017F>tanding, that the Canting party face their pretences with a call from God, the debauch'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

with a Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion from the people. So that if ever this ill contriv'd and equivocal a<U+017F><U+017F>ociation <U+017F>hou'd get uppermo<U+017F>t, they wou'd infallibly contend for the <U+017F>upream right; and as it was formerly on their mony, <U+017F>o now it wou'd be in their intere<U+017F>ts; <hi>God with us</hi> wou'd be <U+017F>et up on one <U+017F>ide, <hi>and the Common-wealth of</hi> England on the other. But I the le<U+017F>s wonder at the mixture of the<U+017F>e two natures, becau<U+017F>e two Salvage bea<U+017F>ts of different <U+017F>pecies and Sexes <U+017F>hut up together, will forget their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to <U+017F>atisfie their common lu<U+017F>t; and 'tis no matter what kind of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ter is produc'd betwixt them, <U+017F>o the brutal appetite be <U+017F>erv'd. I more admire at a third party, who were Loyal when Rebellion was upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t, and have turn'd Rebells (at lea<U+017F>t in principle,) <U+017F>ince Loyalty has been Triumphant.

<pb facs="tcp:47090:11"/>
have <U+017F>ome pretence for di<U+017F>content; and yet they give the World to under<U+017F>tand, that their Honour was not their principle, but their Intere<U+017F>t. If they are old Royalli<U+017F>ts, 'tis a <U+017F>ign their vertue is worn out; and will bear no longer; if Sons to Royalli<U+017F>ts they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably been grafted on Whig <U+017F>tocks, and grown out of kind; like <hi>China</hi> Oranges in <hi>Portugal:</hi> Their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers part has prevail'd in them, and they are degenerated from the Loyalty of their Fathers.</p>
            <p>But if they are <U+017F>uch, as many of them evidently are, who<U+017F>e <U+017F>ervice has been, not only fully but lavi<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompens'd, with Honours and preferment, theirs is an ingratitude without parallel; they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>troy'd their former merits, di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd the cau<U+017F>e for which they fought, bely'd their youth, di<U+017F>hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our'd their age; they have wrought

them<U+017F>elves out of pre<U+017F>ent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for imaginary hopes, and can never be tru<U+017F>ted by their new friends, becau<U+017F>e they have betray'd their old. The greater and the <U+017F>tronger ties which <U+017F>ome of them have had, are the deeper brands of their Apo<U+017F>tacy: For Arch-Angels were the fir<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t glorious of the whole Creation: They were the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work of God; and had the fir<U+017F>t impre<U+017F><U+017F>ions of his Image, what Creatures cou'd be made: They were of kin to Eternity it <U+017F>elf; and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only that acce<U+017F><U+017F>ion to be Deities. Their fall was therefore more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious than that of Man, becau<U+017F>e they had no clay for their excu<U+017F>e: Though I hope and wi<U+017F>h the latter part of the Allegory may not hold, and that repentance may be yet allow'd them. But I delight not to dwell on <U+017F>o <U+017F>ad an object: Let this part of the Land<U+017F>chape be ca<U+017F>t into

<U+017F>hadows, that the heightnings of the other may appear more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. For as Contraries the nearer they are plac'd are brighter, and the <hi>Venus</hi> is illu<U+017F>trated by the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the <hi>Lazar,</hi> <U+017F>o the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemi<U+017F>h'd Loyalty of your Grace, will <U+017F>hine more clearly, when <U+017F>et in competition with their <U+017F>tains.

foot, when one Plot was pro<U+017F>ecuted openly, and another <U+017F>ecretly fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, yet even then was <hi>Ireland</hi> free from our contagion: And if <U+017F>ome venemous Creatures were produc'd in that Nation, yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd they could not live there: They <U+017F>hed their poy<U+017F>on without effect: They de<U+017F>pair'd of being <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>sfully wicked in their own Country, and tran<U+017F>ported their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to another, where they knew 'twas vendible: Where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<U+017F>ation was a Trade, where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries were countenanc'd, where perjuries were rewarded, where <U+017F>wearing went for proof, and where the Merchandize of Death was gainful. That their Te<U+017F>timony was at la<U+017F>t di<U+017F>credited, proceeded not from its incoherence: For they were known by their own party when they fir<U+017F>t appear'd; but their folly was then manag'd by the cunning
<pb facs="tcp:47090:13"/>
of their Tutors; they had <U+017F>till been believ'd, had they <U+017F>till follow'd their In<U+017F>tructors: But when their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s fell foul upon their friends, then they were proclaim'd Villains, di<U+017F>carded and di<U+017F>own'd by tho<U+017F>e who <U+017F>ent for them; they <U+017F>eem'd then fir<U+017F>t to be di<U+017F>cover'd, for what they had been known too well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; they were decry'd as inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of what only they betray'd: Nay their very wit was magnified le<U+017F>t being taken for fools, they might be thought too <U+017F>imple to forge an accu<U+017F>ation. Some of them <U+017F>till continue here dete<U+017F>ted by both <U+017F>ides, believ'd by neither: (for even their betters are at la<U+017F>t uncas'd,) and <U+017F>ome of them have receiv'd their hire in their own Country: For perjury, which is malice to Mankind, is always accompanied with other Crimes: and tho not puni<U+017F>hable by our Laws with death,

yet draws a train of vices after it: The Robber, the Murderer and the Sodomite, have often hung up the for<U+017F>worn villain: And what one <U+017F>in took on tru<U+017F>t, another <U+017F>in has pay'd.

            <p>After this Right done to the <hi>Greek Author,</hi> I <U+017F>hall not need to <U+017F>ay what profit, and delight will accrue to the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h Reader</hi> from <hi>this ver<U+017F>ion,</hi> when he <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ee this <hi>Illu<U+017F>trious piece,</hi> in his own <hi>Mother Tongue;</hi> and the very <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Original,</hi> Transfus'd into the <hi>Traduction.</hi> And in one word; <hi>Plutarchs Worthies</hi> made yet more famous, by a <hi>Tran<U+017F>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that gives a farther Lu<U+017F>tre, even to <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch him<U+017F>elf.</hi>

            <byline>Written by Mr. DRYDEN.</byline>
            <p>I Know not by what Fate it comes to pa<U+017F>s, that Hi<U+017F>torians, who give immortality to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are <U+017F>o ill requited by Po<U+017F>terity, that their Actions and their Fortunes are u<U+017F>ually forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; neither them<U+017F>elves incourag'd, while they live, nor their memory pre<U+017F>erv'd entire to future Ages. 'Tis the ingratitude of Mankind to their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47090:19"/>
greate<U+017F>t Benefactors, that they, who teach us wi<U+017F>dome by the <U+017F>ure<U+017F>t ways, (<U+017F>etting before us what we ought to <U+017F>hun or to pur<U+017F>ue, by the examples of the mo<U+017F>t famous Men whom they Record, and by the experience of their Faults and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,) <U+017F>hould generally live poor and unregarded; as if they were born only for the publick, and had no intere<U+017F>t in their own well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but were to be lighted up like Tapers, and to wa<U+017F>te them<U+017F>elves, for the benefit of others. But this is a complaint too general, and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tom has been too long e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h'd to be remedied; neither does it wholly reach our Author: He was born in an Age, which was <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of his vertue; and found a <hi>Trajan</hi> to reward him, as <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> did an <hi>Alexander.</hi> But the Hi<U+017F>torians, who <U+017F>ucceeded him, have either been too envious, or too carele<U+017F>s of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47090:19"/>
none of them, not even his own Country-men, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us any particular account of him; or if they have, yet their Works are not tran<U+017F>mitted to us; <U+017F>o that we are forc'd to glean from <hi>Plutarch,</hi> what he has <U+017F>catter'd in his Writings, concerning him<U+017F>elf and his Original: Which (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that little memorial, that <hi>Suidas,</hi> and <U+017F>ome few others, have left concerning him) is all we can collect, relating to this great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>opher and Hi<U+017F>torian.</p>
            <p>He was born at <hi>Chaeronea</hi> a <U+017F>mall City of <hi>Boeotia</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> between <hi>Attica</hi> and <hi>Phocis,</hi> and reaching to both Seas. The Climate not much befreinded by the Heavens; for the air is thick and foggy; and con<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Inhabitants partaking of its influence, gro<U+017F>s feeders, and fat witted; brawny, and unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ju<U+017F>t the con<U+017F>titution of Heroes:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47090:20"/>
Cut out for the Executive and brutal bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of War; but <U+017F>o <U+017F>tupid in the de<U+017F>igning part, that in all the revolutions of <hi>Greece</hi> they were never Ma<U+017F>ters, but only in tho<U+017F>e few years, when they were led by <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas,</hi> or <hi>Pelopidas.</hi> Yet this foggy ayre, this Country of fat wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as <hi>Juvenal</hi> calls it, produc'd three wits, which were comparable to any three <hi>Athenians: Pyndar, Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas,</hi> and our <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to whom we may add a fourth, <hi>Sextus Chae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronen<U+017F>is,</hi> the Praeceptor of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius;</hi> and the Nephew of our Authour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Choercnea,</hi> (if we may give credit to <hi>Pau<U+017F>anias,</hi> in the ninth Book of his de<U+017F>cription of <hi>Greece)</hi> was anciently call'd <hi>Arnè;</hi> from <hi>Arnè</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Aeolus;</hi> but being <U+017F>cituated to the we<U+017F>t of <hi>Parna<U+017F><U+017F>us</hi> in that low land country, the natural unwhol<U+017F>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of the Ayre was augmented by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47090:20"/>
the evening Vapours ca<U+017F>t upon it from that Mountain, which our late Travellers de<U+017F>cribe to be full of moi<U+017F>ture and mar<U+017F>hy ground in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clo<U+017F>'d in the inequality of its a<U+017F>cents: And being al<U+017F>o expos'd to the winds which blew from that quarter, the Town was perpetually unhealthful, for which rea<U+017F>on, <U+017F>ayes my Author, <hi>Chaeron,</hi> the Son of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Thero,</hi> made it be rebuilt, and turn'd it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ri<U+017F>ing Sun; From whence the Town became health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and con<U+017F>equently populous; in memory of which benefit it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards retain'd his name. But as <hi>Etymologies</hi> are uncertain, and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> above all Nations, given to fabulous derivations of Names, e<U+017F>pecially, when they tend to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Country, I think we may be rea<U+017F>onably content to take the denomination of the Town from its delightful or chearful <U+017F>tanding; as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47090:21"/>
the word <hi>Chaeron</hi> <U+017F>ufficiently implies.</p>
            <p>But to lo<U+017F>e no time, in the<U+017F>e grammatical <hi>Etymologies,</hi> which are commonly uncertain ghe<U+017F><U+017F>es, 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that <hi>Plutarch</hi> was here born; the year uncertain; but without di<U+017F>pute in the reign of <hi>Claudius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joh. Gerrard Vo<U+017F><U+017F>ius</hi> has a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd his birth in the latter end of that Emperour: Some other Writers of his Life, have left it undecided, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then, or in the beginning of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Empire: But the mo<U+017F>t accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Rualdus</hi> (as I find it in the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition of <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Works) has manife<U+017F>tly prov'd him to be born in the middle time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> or <U+017F>omewhat lower: For <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the in<U+017F>cription at <hi>Delphos,</hi> of which more hereafter, remembers that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monius</hi> his Ma<U+017F>ter di<U+017F>puted with him and his Brother <hi>Lamprias</hi> concerning it, when <hi>Nero</hi> made his progre<U+017F>s into <hi>Greece;</hi> which was in his twelfth year;

and the Que<U+017F>tion di<U+017F>puted cou'd not be manag'd with <U+017F>o much learning as it was, by meer Boyes; therefore he was then <U+017F>ixteen, or rather eighteen years of age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xylander</hi> has ob<U+017F>erv'd that <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> him<U+017F>elf, in the Life of <hi>Pericles,</hi> and that of <hi>Anthony,</hi> has mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> as his Contemporaries. He has al<U+017F>o left it on Record in his <hi>Sympo<U+017F>iaques,</hi> that his Family was ancient in <hi>Chaeronea;</hi> and that for many de<U+017F>cents, they had born the mo<U+017F>t con<U+017F>iderable Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in that petty Common-wealth.

This <hi>Nicarchus,</hi> the Great Grand-Father of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> among other Sons, had <hi>Lamprias,</hi> a Man eminent for his Learning; and a Philo<U+017F>opher, of whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> has made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention in his <hi>Sympo<U+017F>iaques,</hi> or <hi>Table Conver<U+017F>ations,</hi> and among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, there is this ob<U+017F>ervation of him, that he di<U+017F>puted be<U+017F>t, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravell'd the difficulties of Philo<U+017F>ophy with mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s when he was at Supper, and well warm'd with Wine. The<U+017F>e Table Entertainments were part of the Education of tho<U+017F>e times, their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the canva<U+017F>ing and Solution of <U+017F>ome que<U+017F>tion, either Philo<U+017F>ophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Philological, alwayes in<U+017F>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and u<U+017F>ually plea<U+017F>ant; for the Cups went round with the debate; and Men were merry and wi<U+017F>e toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the Proverb. The Father of <hi>Plutarch</hi> is al<U+017F>o men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, in tho<U+017F>e Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, whom
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47090:23"/>
our Author repre<U+017F>ents as arguing of <U+017F>everal points in Philo<U+017F>ophy; but his name is no where to be found in any part of the works re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to us. But yet he <U+017F>peaks of him, as a Man not ignorant in Learning and Poetry, as may appear by what he <U+017F>ays, when he is introduc'd di<U+017F>puting in the <hi>Sympo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>iaques;</hi> where al<U+017F>o his prudence and humanity are commended, in this following Relation. Being yet very young (<U+017F>ays <hi>Plutarch)</hi> I was joyn'd, in Commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion with another in an Emba<U+017F><U+017F>y to the <hi>Procon<U+017F>ul,</hi> and my Collegue falling <U+017F>ick was forc'd to <U+017F>tay behind, <U+017F>o that the whole bu<U+017F>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s was Tran<U+017F>acted by me alone. At my return, when <hi>I</hi> was to give account to the Common-wealth of my proceedings, my Father, ri<U+017F>ing from his Seat, openly enjoyn'd me not to name my <U+017F>elf in the <U+017F>ingular Number, <hi>I did thus, or thus, I <U+017F>ay'd</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47090:23"/>
               <hi>to the Procon<U+017F>ul, but thus we did and thus we <U+017F>ay'd,</hi> alwaies a<U+017F><U+017F>ociating my Companion with me, though ab<U+017F>ent in the management: this was done to ob<U+017F>erve, as I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e, the point of good manners with his Collegue, that of re<U+017F>pect to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the City, who had commi<U+017F><U+017F>ion'd both, to avoid envy, and perhaps more e<U+017F>pecially, to take off the forwardne<U+017F>s of a pert young Mini<U+017F>ter, commonly too apt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vervalue his own <U+017F>ervices, and to quote him<U+017F>elf on every incon<U+017F>ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occa<U+017F>ion. The Father of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> had many Children be<U+017F>ides him; <hi>Timon</hi> and <hi>Lamprias,</hi> his Brothers, were bred up with him, all three in<U+017F>tructed in the Liberal Sciences, and in all parts of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>ophy. 'Tis Manife<U+017F>t from our Author that they liv'd together in great friendline<U+017F>s, and in great veneration to their Grand-father
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47090:24"/>
and Father. What affection <hi>Plutarch</hi> bore in parricular to his Brother <hi>Timon</hi> may be gather'd from the<U+017F>e words of his. As for my <U+017F>elf, though fortune on <U+017F>everal occa<U+017F>ions has been favourable to me, I have no obligation <U+017F>o great to her, as the kindne<U+017F>s, and entire friend<U+017F>hip, which my Brother <hi>Timon</hi> has alwayes born, and <U+017F>till bears me: and this is <U+017F>o evident that it cannot but be not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by every one of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Lamprias,</hi> the younge<U+017F>t of the three, is introduc'd by him in his Morals, as one of a <U+017F>weet and plea<U+017F>ant Conver<U+017F>ation, inclin'd to Mirth and Raillery; or, as we <U+017F>ay in Engli<U+017F>h, a well humour'd man, and a good Companion. The whole Family being thus addicted to Philo<U+017F>ophy, 'tis no wonder if our Author was initiated betimes in Study, to which he was naturally inclin'd. In pur<U+017F>uit of which he

was <U+017F>o happy, to fall into good hands at fir<U+017F>t; being recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the care of <hi>Ammonius</hi> an Egyptian, who, having taught Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>ophy with great Reputation at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and from thence travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into <hi>Greece,</hi> <U+017F>ettled him<U+017F>elf at la<U+017F>t in <hi>Athens,</hi> where he was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and generally re<U+017F>pected.

breeding was the knowledge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the accommodation of that knowledge by Moral precepts, to the <U+017F>ervice of the publick, and the private offices of vertue.

they grew up; but <U+017F>lid ea<U+017F>ily into it, and found no alteration in their Company. Among<U+017F>t the re<U+017F>t, the Reading and Quotations of Poets were not forgotten at their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and in their Walks; but <hi>Homer, Euripides,</hi> and <hi>Sophocles,</hi> were the entertainment of their hours of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47090:26"/>
has remark'd towards the end of his <hi>Platonick</hi> que<U+017F>tions. For like a true Philo<U+017F>opher, who minded things, not words, he <U+017F>trove not even to cultivate his Mother Tongue with any great exactne<U+017F>s. And him<U+017F>elf confe<U+017F><U+017F>es in the beginning of <hi>Demo<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi> his life, that during his abode in <hi>Italy,</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> he had neither the lei<U+017F>ure to <U+017F>tudy, nor <U+017F>o much as to exerci<U+017F>e the <hi>Roman</hi> language; (I <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>e he means to write in it, rather than to <U+017F>peak it,) as well by rea<U+017F>on of the affairs he manag'd, as that he might acquit him<U+017F>elf to tho<U+017F>e who were de<U+017F>irous to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructed by him in Philo<U+017F>ophy. In <U+017F>o much that till the declination of his age, he began not to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ant in Latin books; in reading of which it happened <U+017F>omewhat oddly to him, that he learnt not the knowledge of things by words; but by the under<U+017F>tanding and u<U+017F>e he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47090:27"/>
had of things, attain'd to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of words which <U+017F>ignified them. Ju<U+017F>t as <hi>Adam</hi> (<U+017F>etting a<U+017F>ide divine illumination) call'd the Creatures by their proper Names, by fir<U+017F>t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<U+017F>tanding of their natures. But for the delicacies of the Tongue, the turns of the Expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and connexions of words, in which con<U+017F>i<U+017F>t the beauty of that language, he plainly tells us, that tho he much admir'd them, yet they requir'd too great labour for a Man in Age, and plung'd in bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s to attain perfectly. Which Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement I <U+017F>hou'd be willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve from a Philo<U+017F>opher, if I did not con<U+017F>ider, that <hi>Dion Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ius,</hi> nay even <hi>Herodian,</hi> and <hi>Appian</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, as well as <hi>Polybius</hi> before him, by writing the <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<U+017F>tory in the <hi>Greek</hi> language, had <U+017F>hewn as manife<U+017F>t a contempt of Latin, in re<U+017F>pect of the other, as <hi>French</hi> Men
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47090:27"/>
now do of <hi>Engli<U+017F>h,</hi> which they di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to <U+017F>peak, while they live among us: But with great advantage to their trivial conceptions, drawing the di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour<U+017F>e into their own language, have learnt to de<U+017F>pi<U+017F>e our better thoughts, which mu<U+017F>t come deform'd and lame in conver<U+017F>ation to them, as being tran<U+017F>mitted in a Tongue of which we are not Ma<U+017F>ters. This is to arrogate a <U+017F>uperiority in nature over us, as undoubtedly the <hi>Grecians</hi> did over their Conquerours, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hing their language for a Standard; it being become <U+017F>o much a mode to <U+017F>peak and write <hi>Greek</hi> in <hi>Tully</hi>'s time, that with <U+017F>ome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation I have read his Epi<U+017F>tles to <hi>Atticus,</hi> in which he de<U+017F>ires to have his own con<U+017F>ul<U+017F>hip written by his friend in the <hi>Grecian</hi> language; which he afterwards perform'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf; a vain attempt in my opinion, for any Man to endeavour to excel
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47090:28"/>
in a Tongue which he was not born to <U+017F>peak. This, tho it be digre<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion, yet de<U+017F>erves to be con<U+017F>ider'd at more lei<U+017F>ure; for the honour of of our Wit and Writings, which are of a more <U+017F>olid make than that of our Neighbours, is concern'd in it. But to return to <hi>Plutarch,</hi> as it was his good fortune to be moulded fir<U+017F>t by Ma<U+017F>ters the mo<U+017F>t excellent in their kind, <U+017F>o it was his own vertue, to <U+017F>uck in with an incredible de<U+017F>ire, and earne<U+017F>t application of mind, their wi<U+017F>e in<U+017F>tructions; and it was al<U+017F>o his prudence <U+017F>o to manage his health by moderation of diet and bodily exerci<U+017F>e, as to pre<U+017F>erve his parts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out decay to a great old age; to be lively and vigorous to the la<U+017F>t, and to pre<U+017F>erve him<U+017F>elf to his own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and to the profit of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Which was not difficult for him to perform, having receiv'd from nature a con<U+017F>titution capable
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47090:28"/>
of labour; and from the Dome<U+017F>tick example of his Parents, a <U+017F>paring <U+017F>obriety of diet, a temperance in other plea<U+017F>ures, and above all an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude of commanding his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions in order to his health. Thus prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, and grounded, he con<U+017F>ider'd with him<U+017F>elf, that a larger Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with learned Men was nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary for his accompli<U+017F>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore, having a Soul in<U+017F>atiable of knowledge, and being ambitious to excell in all kinds of Science, he took up a re<U+017F>olution to Travel. <hi>Egypt</hi> was at that time, as formerly it had been, famous for learning; and probably the My<U+017F>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of their Doctrine might tempt him, as it had done <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and others, to conver<U+017F>e with the Prie<U+017F>t-hood of that Country, which appears to have been particularly his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s by the Treati<U+017F>e of <hi>I<U+017F>is</hi> and <hi>O<U+017F>yris,</hi> which he has left us. In
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47090:29"/>
which he <U+017F>hews him<U+017F>elf not meanly vers'd, in the ancient Theology and Philo<U+017F>ophy of tho<U+017F>e wi<U+017F>e Men. From <hi>Egypt</hi> returning into <hi>Greece,</hi> he vi<U+017F>ited in his way all the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies, or Schools of the <U+017F>everal Philo<U+017F>ophers, and gather'd from them many of tho<U+017F>e ob<U+017F>ervations with which he has enrich'd Po<U+017F>teri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Be<U+017F>ides this, he applyed him<U+017F>elf, with extream diligence, to collect not only all books which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in their kind, and already publi<U+017F>h'd, but al<U+017F>o all <U+017F>ayings and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es of wi<U+017F>e Men, which he had heard in conver<U+017F>ation, or which he had receiv'd from others by Tradition. As likewi<U+017F>e the Records and publick In<U+017F>truments, pre<U+017F>erv'd in Cities, which he had vi<U+017F>ited in his Travels; and which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <U+017F>catter'd through his works. To which purpo<U+017F>e he took a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47090:29"/>
Journy to <hi>Sparta,</hi> to <U+017F>earch the Archives of that famous Commonwealth, to under<U+017F>tand throughly the model of their ancient Government, their Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>lators, their Kings, and their <hi>Ephori,</hi> dige<U+017F>ting all their memor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deeds and <U+017F>ayings, with <U+017F>o much care, that he has not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted tho<U+017F>e even of their Women, or their private Souldiers; together with their Cu<U+017F>tomes, their Decrees, their Ceremonies, and the manner of their publick and private living, both in peace and war. The <U+017F>ame methods he al<U+017F>o took in divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commonwealths, as his Lives, and his <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Que<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <U+017F>ufficiently te<U+017F>tifie. Without the<U+017F>e helps it had been impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible for him to leave in writing <U+017F>o many particular ob<U+017F>ervations of Men and manners, and as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F><U+017F>ible to have gatherd them,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47090:30"/>
without conver<U+017F>ation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the learned Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries of his time. To the<U+017F>e he added a curious Collection of Ancient Statues, Medals, In<U+017F>crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Paintings, as al<U+017F>o of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial <U+017F>ayings, Epigrams, Epitaphs, Apothegmes, and other Ornaments of Hi<U+017F>tory, that he might leave nothing un<U+017F>wept behind him. And as he was continually in Company with Men of learning, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>ions, <U+017F>o his memory was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways on the <U+017F>tretch, to receive and lodge their di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es; and his Judgment perpetually employ'd in <U+017F>eparating his notions, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hing which were fit to be pre<U+017F>erv'd, and which to be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>By benefit of this, in little time he inlarg'd his knowledge to a great extent in every Science; him<U+017F>elf in the beginning of the Treati<U+017F>e
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47090:30"/>
which he has compos'd of <hi>Content, and Peace of mind,</hi> makes mention of tho<U+017F>e Collections, or Common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which he had long <U+017F>ince drawn together for his own particular occa<U+017F>ions: And 'tis from this rich Cabinet that he has taken out tho<U+017F>e excellent peices, which he has di<U+017F>tributed to Po<U+017F>terity, and which give us occa<U+017F>ion to deplore the lo<U+017F>s of the re<U+017F>idue, which either the injury of time, or the negligence of Coppiers have denyed to us. On this account, tho we need not doubt to give him this general commendation, that he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of no <U+017F>ort of learning, yet we may ju<U+017F>tly add this farther, that whoever will con<U+017F>ider through the whole body of his Works, either the de<U+017F>ign, the method, or the contexture of his Di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hi<U+017F>torical or Moral, or Que<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of natural Philo<U+017F>ophy, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Solutions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47090:31"/>
of Problems Mathematical, whether he arraigns the opinions of others Sects, or e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>hes the Doctrines of his own, in all the<U+017F>e kinds there will be found, both the harmony of order and the beauty of ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. His rea<U+017F>ons <U+017F>o <U+017F>olid and convincing, his inductions <U+017F>o plea<U+017F>ant and agreeable to all <U+017F>orts of Readers, that it mu<U+017F>t be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged he was Ma<U+017F>ter of every Subject which he treated, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none but what were improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the benefit of In<U+017F>truction. For we may perceive in his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the de<U+017F>ire he had to imprint his Precepts in the Souls of his Readers; and to lodge Morality in Families, nay even to exalt it to the Thrones of Soveraign Princes, and to make it the Rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ure of their Government. Finding that there were many Sects of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>ophers then in vogue, he <U+017F>earch'd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47090:31"/>
into the foundation of all their principles and opinions; and not content with this di<U+017F>qui<U+017F>ition, he trac'd them to their <U+017F>everal foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. So that the <hi>Pythagorean, Epicurean, Stoick</hi> and <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Philo<U+017F>ophy were familiar to him. And tho it may be ea<U+017F>ily ob<U+017F>erv'd that he was chiefly inclin'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Plato</hi> (who<U+017F>e memory he <U+017F>o much reverenc'd, that Annually he celebrated his Birth-day, and al<U+017F>o that of <hi>Socrates;)</hi> yet he mode<U+017F>tly contain'd him<U+017F>elf within the bounds of the latter Academy, and was content, like <hi>Cicero,</hi> only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and weigh opinions, leaving the Judgment of his Readers free without pre<U+017F>uming to decide Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically. Yet it is to be confe<U+017F>s'd, that in the mid<U+017F>t of this moderation, he oppos'd the two extreams of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> and <hi>Stoick</hi> Sects: Both which he has judiciou<U+017F>ly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batted
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47090:32"/>
in <U+017F>everal of his Treati<U+017F>es, and both upon the <U+017F>ame account, becau<U+017F>e they pretend too much to certainty, in their Dogma's; and to impo<U+017F>e them with too great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance; which he, who (follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Academi<U+017F>ts,) doubted more and pretended le<U+017F>s, was no way able to <U+017F>upport. The <hi>Pyrrhonians,</hi> or gro<U+017F><U+017F>er <U+017F>ort of <hi>Scepticks,</hi> who bring all certainty in que<U+017F>tion, and <U+017F>tartle even at the notions of Common <U+017F>en<U+017F>e, appear'd as ab<U+017F>urd to him on the other <U+017F>ide; for there is a kind of po<U+017F>itivene<U+017F>s in granting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be more likely on one part than on another, which his Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy avoided by inclining the ballance to that hand, where the mo<U+017F>t weighty rea<U+017F>ons, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of truth were vi<U+017F>ible. The Moral Philo<U+017F>ophy therefore was his chiefe<U+017F>t aym; becau<U+017F>e the principles of it admitted of le<U+017F>s doubt; and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47090:32"/>
becau<U+017F>e they were mo<U+017F>t conducing to the benefit of human life. For after the Example of <hi>Socrates</hi> he had found, that the <U+017F>peculations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philo<U+017F>ophy, were more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful than <U+017F>olid and profitable; that they were ab<U+017F>truce and thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and much of <hi>Sophi<U+017F>m</hi> in the <U+017F>olution of appearances. That the Mathematicks indeed, cou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his pains with many demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>trations, but tho they made him wi<U+017F>er, they made him not more vertuous, and therefore attain'd not the end of happine<U+017F>s: For which rea<U+017F>on tho he had far advanc'd in that <U+017F>tudy, yet he made it but his Recreation, not his bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s. Some Problem of it, was his u<U+017F>ual diverti<U+017F>ement at Supper, which he mingled al<U+017F>o with plea<U+017F>ant and more light di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es.

with reference to vertue: He forgot not to be plea<U+017F>ant while he in<U+017F>truct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and entertain'd his friends with <U+017F>o much chearfulne<U+017F>s and good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that his learning was not nau<U+017F>eous to them; neither were they affraid of his Company ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time.

            <p>The Religion he profe<U+017F>s'd, to <U+017F>peak the wor<U+017F>e of it, was Heathen.

He was indeed a <hi>Prie<U+017F>t of Apollo,</hi> as him<U+017F>elf acknowledges, but that proves him not to have been a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lythei<U+017F>t.</hi>

            <p>I have ever thought, that the Wi<U+017F>e-men in all Ages, have not much differ'd in their opinions of Religion; I mean as it is grounded on human Rea<U+017F>on: For Rea<U+017F>on, as as far as it is right, mu<U+017F>t be the <U+017F>ame in all Men; and Truth being but one, they mu<U+017F>t con<U+017F>equently think in the <U+017F>ame Train. Thus it is not to be doubted, but the Religion of <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> was not different in the main: Who doubtle<U+017F>s beleiv'd the identity of one Supream Intellectual Being, which we call GOD. But becau<U+017F>e they who have written the Life of <hi>Plutarch</hi> in other languages, are contented barely to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert that our Authour believ'd one God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out quoting tho<U+017F>e pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages of his

weigh'd; and in both ca<U+017F>es he mu<U+017F>t of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity be ignorant, becau<U+017F>e he cou'd not know without Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and the Revelation was not to him. But leaving the Soul of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> with our Charitable wi<U+017F>hes, to his Maker, we can only trace the re<U+017F>t of his opinions in Religion from his Philo<U+017F>ophy: Which we have <U+017F>aid in the General to be <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick;</hi> tho it cannot al<U+017F>o be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, that there was a tincture in it of the <hi>Electick</hi> Sect, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by <hi>Potamon</hi> under the Empire of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> and which <U+017F>elected from all the other Sects, what <U+017F>eem'd mo<U+017F>t probable in their opinions, not adhering <U+017F>ingularly to any of them, nor rejecting every thing.

in former times; he <U+017F>eems to a<U+017F><U+017F>ert the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Doctrine of Tran<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of Souls.

Who, having fir<U+017F>t been Men, and following the <U+017F>trict Rules of vertue had purg'd off the gro<U+017F><U+017F>ne<U+017F>s and faeculency of their earthly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are exalted into the<U+017F>e <hi>Genii;</hi> and are from thence either rais'd higher into an Aetherial life, if they <U+017F>till continue vertuous, or tumbled down again into Mortal Bodies, and <U+017F>inking into fle<U+017F>h after they have lo<U+017F>t that purity, which con<U+017F>tituted their glorious being.

            <p>I cannot but wonder that every one, who has hitherto written <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchs Life,</hi> and particularly <hi>Rualdus,</hi> the mo<U+017F>t knowing of them all, <U+017F>hould <U+017F>o confidently affirm that the<U+017F>e Oracles, were given by bad Spirits according to <hi>Plutarch:</hi> As Chri<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, indeed we may think them <U+017F>o; but that <hi>Plutarch</hi> <U+017F>o thought, is a mo<U+017F>t apparent fal<U+017F>hood: 'Tis enough to convince a rea<U+017F>onable Man that our Author in his old age, (and that then he doted not, we may <U+017F>ee by the Treati<U+017F>e he has written, that old Men ought to have the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of publick Affairs) I <U+017F>ay that then he initiated him<U+017F>elf, in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Rities of <hi>Delphos;</hi> and dyed, for ought we know, <hi>Apollo's Prie<U+017F>t.</hi>

            <p>I will in the next place <U+017F>peak of his Marriage. His Wifes name, her Parentage, and Dowry are no where mention'd by him, or any other, nor in what part of his age he Married: Tho 'tis probable, in the flower of it: But <hi>Rualdus</hi> has ingeniou<U+017F>ly gather'd from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing circum<U+017F>tance, that <U+017F>he was called <hi>Timoxena:</hi> Becau<U+017F>e <hi>Plutarch</hi> in a Con<U+017F>olatory Letter to her, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion'd by the Death of their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in her Infancy, u<U+017F>es the<U+017F>e words: <hi>Your</hi> Timoxena <hi>is depriv'd (by death) of <U+017F>mall enjoyments; for the things <U+017F>he knew were of <U+017F>mall moment, and <U+017F>he cou'd be delighted only with triffles.</hi> Now it appears by the Letter, that the Name of this Daughter was the <U+017F>ame with her Mothers, therefore
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47090:42"/>
it cou'd be no other than <hi>Timoxena.</hi> Her knowledge, her conjugal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, her abhorrency from the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of her Sex, and from <U+017F>uper<U+017F>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, her gravity in behaviour and her con<U+017F>tancy in <U+017F>upporting the lo<U+017F>s of Children, are likewi<U+017F>e Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by our Author. No other wife of <hi>Plutarch</hi> is found mention'd; and therefore we may conclude he he had no more: By the <U+017F>ame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on for which we Judge that he had no other Ma<U+017F>ter than <hi>Ammonius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e 'tis evident he was <U+017F>o grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his nature, that he would have pre<U+017F>erv'd their Memory.</p>
            <p>The number of his Children was at lea<U+017F>t five; <U+017F>o many being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by him. Four of them were Sons; of the other Sex only <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moxena,</hi> who died at two years old, as is manife<U+017F>t from the Epi<U+017F>tle above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd.

Engli<U+017F>h Tran<U+017F>lation of the Lives was made, <U+017F>uppo<U+017F>es him to have had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Daughter, where he <U+017F>peaks of his Son-in-Law <hi>Crato.</hi> But the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> there u<U+017F>es, is of a larger <U+017F>ignification; for it may as well be expounded Father-in-law, his Wifes Brother, or his Si<U+017F>ters Husband, as <hi>Budaeus</hi> notes: This I the rather mention, becau<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame <hi>Amiot</hi> is task'd for an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of mi<U+017F>takes, by his own Country-men of the pre<U+017F>ent Age; which is enough to recommend this Tran<U+017F>lation of our Authour into the Engli<U+017F>h tongue, being not from any Copy, but from the <hi>Greek</hi> Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.

two remaining are <U+017F>uppos'd to have <U+017F>urviv'd him. The Name of one was <hi>Plutarch,</hi> after his own; and that of the other <hi>Lamprias,</hi> <U+017F>o call'd in memory of his Grand-father. This was he, of all his Children, who <U+017F>eems to have inherited his Fathers Philo<U+017F>ophy: And to him we owe the Table or Catalogue of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Writings, and perhaps al<U+017F>o the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegms.</hi> His Nephew, but whether by his Brother or Si<U+017F>ter remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, was <hi>Sextus Chaeroneus,</hi> who was much honour'd by that learned Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and who taught him the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, and the principles of Philo<U+017F>ophy: This Emperour profe<U+017F><U+017F>ing <hi>Stoici<U+017F>m,</hi> (as appears by his Writings,) inclines us to believe, that our <hi>Sextus Chae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneus,</hi> was of the <hi>Stoick</hi> Sect; and con<U+017F>equently, that the World has generally been mi<U+017F>taken, in <U+017F>uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing him to have been the <U+017F>ame man

with <hi>Sextus Empiricus</hi> the <hi>Sceptick;</hi> whom <hi>Suidas</hi> plainly tells us to have been an <hi>African:</hi> Now <hi>Empiricus</hi> cou'd not but be a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> for he oppo<U+017F>es all Dogmati<U+017F>ts, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly them. But I heard it fir<U+017F>t ob<U+017F>erv'd by an ingenious and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned old Gentleman lately decea<U+017F>'d, that many of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his <U+017F>eeming new opinions, are gather'd from tho<U+017F>e which <hi>Sextus Empiricus</hi> expos'd. The Book is extant, and I refer the curious to it, not pretending to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, or to excu<U+017F>e him. Some think the Famous Critick <hi>Longinus</hi> was of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Family, de<U+017F>cended from a Si<U+017F>ter of his; but the proofs are <U+017F>o weak, that I will not in<U+017F>ert them: They may both of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on their proper merits; and <U+017F>tand not in want of a Relation to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Children, his care of their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are all manife<U+017F>t in that part of his Works which is call'd his Morals. Other parts of his di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition have been touch'd already; as that he was courteous and humane to all Men; free from incon<U+017F>tancy, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the de<U+017F>ire of revenge; which qualities of his, as they have been prais'd by the Authority of other Writers, may al<U+017F>o be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended from his own Te<U+017F>timony of him<U+017F>elf. <hi>I had rather,</hi> <U+017F>ays he, <hi>be forgotten in the memory of Men, and that it <U+017F>hou'd be <U+017F>aid, there neither is, nor was a Man call'd</hi> Plutarch, <hi>then that they <U+017F>hould report, this</hi> Plutarch <hi>was uncon<U+017F>tant, changeable in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, prone to anger and revenge on the lea<U+017F>t occa<U+017F>ions.</hi> What he was to his Slaves you may believe from this, that in general he accu<U+017F>es tho<U+017F>e Ma<U+017F>ters of extream hardne<U+017F>s and inju<U+017F>tice, who u<U+017F>e Men like Oxen;

At la<U+017F>t he began to bawl out lowder; and, leaving off his groaning, his <U+017F>ighs and, his lamentations, to argue the matter with more <U+017F>hew of rea<U+017F>on: And, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <U+017F>uch a Ma<U+017F>ter, he mu<U+017F>t needs have gain'd a <U+017F>mattering of learning, he cryd out that</hi> Plutarch <hi>was not the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<U+017F>opher he pretended him<U+017F>elf to be, That he had heard him waging War again<U+017F>t all the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions; and maintaining that anger was unbecoming a wi<U+017F>e Man: Nay, that he had written a particular Treati<U+017F>e, in commendation of Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

            <p>His love to his Friends and his gratitude to his Benefactors are every where ob<U+017F>ervable, in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of his <U+017F>everal Works, and

the particular Treati<U+017F>es he has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to them on <U+017F>everal occa<U+017F>ions, are all <U+017F>uitable either to the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters of the Men, or to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent condition, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances under which they were. His love to his Country, is from hence con<U+017F>picuous, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F><U+017F>es to have written the Life of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and to have pre<U+017F>erv'd the memory of his actions, becau<U+017F>e of the favours he conferr'd on the City of <hi>Chaeronea;</hi> which tho his Country receiv'd <U+017F>o long before, yet he thought it appertain'd to him to repay them, and took an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere<U+017F>t in their acknowledgment.

tho<U+017F>e Letters from the Emperour.

            <p>It may be conjectur'd, and with <U+017F>ome <U+017F>hew of probability, from hence, that our Author not only collected his materials, but al<U+017F>o made a rough draught of many of the<U+017F>e parallel Lives at <hi>Rome;</hi> and that he read them to <hi>Trajan</hi> for his in<U+017F>truction in Government; and <U+017F>o
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47090:53"/>
much the rather I believe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e all Hi<U+017F>torians agree, that this Emperour, tho naturally prudent and inclin'd to vertue, had more of the Souldier than the Scholar in his Education, before he had the happine<U+017F>s to know <hi>Plutarch;</hi> for which rea<U+017F>on the <hi>Roman</hi> Lives, and the in<U+017F>pection into ancient Laws might be of nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary u<U+017F>e to his direction. And now for the time of our Authors abode in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial City, if he came <U+017F>o early as <hi>Ve<U+017F>patian,</hi> and departed not till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Trajan</hi>'s death, as is generally thought, he might continue in <hi>Italy</hi> near forty years.

age, he dedicated to his friend <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necio</hi> <U+017F>till living, as appears by what he has written, in the Proem to his Lives.</p>
            <p>The de<U+017F>ire of vi<U+017F>iting his own Country, <U+017F>o natural to all Men, and the approaches of old age, (for he could not be much le<U+017F>s than <U+017F>ix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,) and perhaps al<U+017F>o the death of <hi>Trajan,</hi> prevail'd with him at la<U+017F>t to leave <hi>Italy;</hi> or if you will have it in his own words, <hi>he was not willing his little City, <U+017F>hou'd be one the le<U+017F>s by his ab<U+017F>ence:</hi> After his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he was, by the unanimous con<U+017F>ent of his Citizens, cho<U+017F>en <hi>Archon,</hi> or Chief Magi<U+017F>trate of <hi>Chaeronea;</hi> and not long after admitted him<U+017F>elf in the number of <hi>Apollo's</hi> Prie<U+017F>ts; in both which employments he <U+017F>eems to have continued till his death: Of which we have no particular account, either as to the manner of it, or the year; only tis evident that he liv'd

to a great old age, always continuing his Studies; that he dyed a natural death, is only pre<U+017F>um'd, becau<U+017F>e any violent accident to <U+017F>o famous a Man would have been recorded: And in what<U+017F>oever Reign he deceas'd, the days of Tyranny were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<U+017F>s'd, and there was then a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Series</hi> of Emperours, every one emulating his Predece<U+017F><U+017F>ours ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>Thus I have Collected from <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> him<U+017F>elf, and from the <hi>be<U+017F>t Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> what was mo<U+017F>t remarkable concerning him.

            <p>Now this relation is a meer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium of the <U+017F>ame conference, from <hi>Livy.</hi> But if we can conceive <hi>Plutarch</hi> to have written the Life of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> tis hard to believe, that he <U+017F>hould tell the <U+017F>ame <U+017F>tory after <U+017F>o different, or rather <U+017F>o contrary a manner, in another place.

The <U+017F>prings and motives of actions are not here <U+017F>ought, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s they offer them<U+017F>elves, and are open to every Mans di<U+017F>cernment.

The <U+017F>tile is ea<U+017F>ie, <U+017F>imple, unforc'd, and unadorn'd with the pomp of figures; Coun<U+017F>els, gue<U+017F><U+017F>es, politick ob<U+017F>ervations, <U+017F>enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Orations are avoyded: In few words a bare Narration is its bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47090:62"/>
<U+017F>ome part of it mu<U+017F>t be either lame or wanting; except it be <U+017F>upply'd by the Excur<U+017F>ion of the Writer: Herein likewi<U+017F>e mu<U+017F>t be le<U+017F>s of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety for the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on; becau<U+017F>e the fortunes and actions of one Man are related, not tho<U+017F>e of many. Thus the actions and atchievements of <hi>Sylla, Lucullus,</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> are all of them but the <U+017F>ucce<U+017F><U+017F>ive parts of the <hi>Mithridatick War:</hi> Of which we cou'd have no perfect image, if the <U+017F>ame hand had not given us the whole, tho at <U+017F>everal views, in their particular Lives.</p>
            <p>Yet, tho we allow, for the rea<U+017F>ons above alledg'd, that this kind of writing is in dignity inferiour to <hi>Hi<U+017F>tory</hi> and <hi>Annalls,</hi> in plea<U+017F>ure and in<U+017F>truction it equals, or even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells both of them. 'Tis not only commended by ancient practice, to celebrate the memory of great and worthy Men, as the be<U+017F>t thanks
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47090:63"/>
which Po<U+017F>terity can pay them; but al<U+017F>o the examples of vertue are of more vigor, when they are thus contracted into individuals. As the Sun beams, united in a burning-gla<U+017F>s to a point, have greater, force than when they are darted from a plain <U+017F>uperficies; <U+017F>o the vertues and actions of one Man, drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into a <U+017F>ingle <U+017F>tory, <U+017F>trike upon our minds a <U+017F>tronger and more lively impre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, than the <U+017F>catter'd Relations of many Men, and many actions; and by the <U+017F>ame means that they give us plea<U+017F>ure they afford us profit too. For when the under<U+017F>tanding is intent and fix'd on a <U+017F>ingle thing, it carries clo<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>er to the mark, every part of the object <U+017F>inks into it, and the Soul receives it unmixt and whole. For this rea<U+017F>on <hi>Ari<U+017F>totle</hi> Commends the unity of action in a Poem; becau<U+017F>e the mind is not capable of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47090:63"/>
dige<U+017F>ting many things at once, nor of conceiving fully any more than one Idea at a time. What<U+017F>oever di<U+017F>tracts the plea<U+017F>ure, le<U+017F><U+017F>ens it. And as the Reader is more concern'd at one Mans fortune, than tho<U+017F>e of many; <U+017F>o likewi<U+017F>e the Writer is more capable of making a perfect Work, if he confine him<U+017F>elf to this narrow compa<U+017F>s. The lineaments, features, and colourings of a <U+017F>ingle picture may be hit exactly; but in a Hi<U+017F>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-piece of many figures, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral de<U+017F>ign, the ordinance or di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<U+017F>ition of it, the Relation of one figure to another, the diver<U+017F>ity of the po<U+017F>ture, habits, <U+017F>hadowings, and all the other graces con<U+017F>piring to an uniformity, are of <U+017F>o difficult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, that neither is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>emblance of particular per<U+017F>ons of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten perfect, nor the beauty of the piece compleat: For any con<U+017F>ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable errour in the parts, renders the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47090:64"/>
whole di<U+017F>agreeable and lame. Thus then the perfection of the Work, and the benefit ari<U+017F>ing from it are both more ab<U+017F>olute in <hi>Biography</hi> than in Hi<U+017F>tory: All Hi<U+017F>tory is only the precepts of Moral Philo<U+017F>ophy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into Examples: <hi>Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ophy</hi> is divided into two parts, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks</hi> and <hi>Politicks;</hi> the fir<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tructs us in our private offices of vertue; the <U+017F>econd in tho<U+017F>e which relate to the management of the Common-wealth. Both of the<U+017F>e teach by Argumentation and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>oning: Which ru<U+017F>h as it were into the mind, and po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F>s it with violence: But Hi<U+017F>tory rather allures than forces us to vertue. There is nothing of the Tyrant in Example; but it gently glides into us, is ea<U+017F>ie and plea<U+017F>ant in its pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and in one word reduces into practi<U+017F>e, our <U+017F>peculative notions. Therefore the more powerful the Examples are,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47090:64"/>
they are the more u<U+017F>eful al<U+017F>o: And by being more known they are more powerful. Now unity, which is defin'd is in its own nature more apt to be under<U+017F>tood, than mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity, which in <U+017F>ome mea<U+017F>ure participates of infinity.

               <hi>Biographia,</hi> or the Hi<U+017F>tories of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Lives, tho circum<U+017F>crib'd in the <U+017F>ubject, is yet more exten<U+017F>ive in the <U+017F>tile than the other two: For it not only comprehends them both, but has <U+017F>omewhat <U+017F>uperadded, which neither of them have. The <U+017F>tile of it is various, according to the occa<U+017F>ion. There are proper places in it, for the plainne<U+017F>s and nakedne<U+017F>s of narration, which is a<U+017F>crib'd to Annals; there is al<U+017F>o room re<U+017F>erv'd for the loftine<U+017F>s and gravity of general Hi<U+017F>tory, when the actions related <U+017F>hall require that manner of expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. But
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47090:65"/>
there is withal, a de<U+017F>cent into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute circum<U+017F>tances, and trivial pa<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ages of life, which are natural to this way of writing, and which the dignity of the other two will not admit. There you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted only into the rooms of <U+017F>tate; here you are led into the private Lodgings of the Heroe: you <U+017F>ee him in his undre<U+017F>s, and are made Familiar with his mo<U+017F>t pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate actions and conver<U+017F>ations. You may behold a <hi>Scipio</hi> and a <hi>Lelius</hi> gathering Cockle-<U+017F>hells on the <U+017F>hore, <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus</hi> playing at bounding <U+017F>tones with <hi>Boyes;</hi> and <hi>Age<U+017F>ilaus</hi> riding on a Hobby-hor<U+017F>e among his Children. The Pageantry of Life is taken away; you <U+017F>ee the poor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onable Animal, as naked as ever nature made him; are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and find the <hi>Demy-God</hi> a <hi>Man.

once defended this kind of Relating little pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages. For in the Life of <hi>Alexander</hi> he <U+017F>ays thus. <hi>In writing the Lives of Illu<U+017F>trious Men I am not tyed to the Laws of Hi<U+017F>tory: Nor does it follow, that becau<U+017F>e an action is great, it therefore manife<U+017F>ts the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s and vertue of him who did it; but on the other <U+017F>ide <U+017F>ometimes a word, or a ca<U+017F>ual je<U+017F>t, betrays a Man more to our knowledge of him, than a Battel fought wherein ten thou<U+017F>and Men were <U+017F>lain, or <U+017F>acking of Cities, or a cour<U+017F>e of Victories.</hi> In another place he quotes <hi>Xenophon</hi> on the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion: <q>The <U+017F>ayings of great Men, in their familiar di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es and amid<U+017F>t their Wine, have <U+017F>omewhat in them, which is worthy to be tran<U+017F>mitted to Po<U+017F>terity.</q> Our Author therefore needs no excu<U+017F>e, but rather de<U+017F>erves a commendation, when he relates, as plea<U+017F>ant, <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ayings of his <hi>Heroes,</hi> which appear, (I mu<U+017F>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<U+017F>s

it) very cold and in<U+017F>ipid mirth to us. For 'tis not his meaning to commend the je<U+017F>t, but to paint the Man; be<U+017F>ides, we may have lo<U+017F>t <U+017F>omewhat of the Idioti<U+017F>m of that Language in which it was <U+017F>poken; and where the conceit is couch'd in a <U+017F>ingle word, if all the <U+017F>ignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of it are not critically under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tood, the grace and the plea<U+017F>antry are lo<U+017F>t. But in all parts of <hi>Bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,</hi> whether familiar or <U+017F>tately, whether <U+017F>ublime, or low, whether <U+017F>erious or merry, <hi>Plutarch</hi> equally excell'd: If we compare him to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Dion Ca<U+017F><U+017F>ius</hi> is not <U+017F>o <U+017F>incere, <hi>Herodian,</hi> a lover of truth, is often times deceiv'd him<U+017F>elf, with what he had fal<U+017F>ly heard reported; then the time of his Emperours exceeds not in all above <U+017F>ixty years; <U+017F>o that his whole Hi<U+017F>tory will <U+017F>carce amount to three Lives of <hi>Plutarch. Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> may be call'd
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47090:66"/>
alike, either Authors of Hi<U+017F>tories, or Writers of Lives: But the fir<U+017F>t of them runs too willingly into ob<U+017F>cene de<U+017F>criptions, which he teaches while he relates; the other be<U+017F>ides what has already been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, often falls into ob<U+017F>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and both of them have made <U+017F>o unlucky a choice of times, that they are forc'd to de<U+017F>cribe rather Mon<U+017F>ters than Men; and their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours are either extravagant Fools, or Tyrants, and mo<U+017F>t u<U+017F>ually both. Our Author on the contrary, as he was more inclin'd to commend than to di<U+017F>prai<U+017F>e, has generally cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en <U+017F>uch great Men as were famous for their <U+017F>everal vertues; at lea<U+017F>t <U+017F>uch who<U+017F>e frailties or vices were over-pois'd by their excellencies; <U+017F>uch from who<U+017F>e Examples we may have more to follow than to <U+017F>hun. Yet, as he was impartial, he di<U+017F>guis'd not the faults of any Man. An

Example of which is in the Life of <hi>Lucullus;</hi> where, after he has told us, that the double benefit which his Country-men, the <hi>Chae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneans,</hi> receiv'd from him, was the chiefe<U+017F>t motive which he had to write his Life, he afterwards rips up his Luxury, and <U+017F>hews how he lo<U+017F>t, through his mi<U+017F>-management, his Authority, and his Souldiers love. Then he was more happy in his digre<U+017F><U+017F>ions than any we have nam'd. I have alwayes been pleas'd to <U+017F>ee him, and his imitator, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taign,</hi> when they <U+017F>trike a little out of the common road: For we are <U+017F>ure to be the better for their wandring.</p>
            <p>The be<U+017F>t quarry lies not always in the open field: And who would not be content to follow a good Hunt<U+017F>man over Hedges and Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches when he knows the Game will reward his pains? But if we mark him more narrowly, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47090:67"/>
that the great rea<U+017F>on of his frequent <U+017F>tarts, is the variety of his Learning: He knew <U+017F>o much of Nature, was <U+017F>o va<U+017F>tly furni<U+017F>h'd with all the trea<U+017F>ures of the mind, that he was unea<U+017F>ie to him<U+017F>elf, and was forc'd, as I may <U+017F>ay, to lay down <U+017F>ome at every pa<U+017F><U+017F>age, and to <U+017F>cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his riches as he went: Like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Adrian,</hi> he built a City, or planted a Colony in every part of his progre<U+017F>s; and left behind him <U+017F>ome memorial of his greatne<U+017F>s. <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Thebes,</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F>s of the World, he has di<U+017F>cover'd in their foundations, their in<U+017F>titutions, their growth, their heigth, the decay of the three fir<U+017F>t, and the alteration of the la<U+017F>t. You <U+017F>ee tho<U+017F>e <U+017F>everal peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their different laws, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, and forms of Government, in their Warriours, and Senators, and Demagogues. Nor are the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47090:68"/>
of Poetry, and the illu<U+017F>trati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <U+017F>imilitudes forgotten by him; in both which he in<U+017F>tructs as well as plea<U+017F>es: Or rather plea<U+017F>es that he may in<U+017F>truct.</p>
            <p>This la<U+017F>t reflection leads me na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, to <U+017F>ay <U+017F>omewhat in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his <U+017F>tile, tho after having ju<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prais'd him for copiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of learning, integrity, per<U+017F>picuity, and more than all this for a certain air of goodne<U+017F>s which appears through all his Writings, it were unrea<U+017F>ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be critical on his Elocution: As on a tree which bears excellent fruit, we con<U+017F>ider not the beauty of the blo<U+017F><U+017F>oms: For if they are not plea<U+017F>ant to the eye, or delightful to the <U+017F>cent, we know at the <U+017F>ame time that they are not the prime intention of Nature, but are thru<U+017F>t out in order to their product; <U+017F>o in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who<U+017F>e bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was not to plea<U+017F>e the ear, but to charm and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47090:68"/>
to in<U+017F>truct the mind, we may ea<U+017F>ily forgive the cadences of words, and the roughne<U+017F>s of expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion: Yet for manline<U+017F>s of Eloquence, if it abounded not in our Author, it was not wanting in him: He neither <U+017F>tudyed the <U+017F>ublime <U+017F>tile, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the flowry. The choice of words, the numbers of periods, the turns of Sentences, and tho<U+017F>e other Ornaments of <U+017F>peech, he neither <U+017F>ought, nor <U+017F>hun'd. But the depth of <U+017F>ence, the accuracy of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of the parts and contexture of the whole, in <U+017F>o admirable and va<U+017F>t a field of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and la<U+017F>tly the copiou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of words, appear <U+017F>hining in our Author. Tis indeed, ob<U+017F>erv'd of him, that he keeps not always to the <U+017F>tile of pro<U+017F>e, but if a Poetical word, which carries in it more of Empha<U+017F>is or <U+017F>ignification, offer it <U+017F>elf at any time, he refu<U+017F>es it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e

               <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Eurypides</hi> have us'd it: But if this be a fault I know not how <hi>Xenophon</hi> will <U+017F>tand excus'd. Yet neither do I compare our Author with him, or with <hi>Herodotus</hi> in the <U+017F>weetne<U+017F>s and graces of his <U+017F>tile, nor with <hi>Thuyidides</hi> in the <U+017F>olidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and clo<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s of expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion. For <hi>Herodotus</hi> is acknowledg'd the Prince of the <hi>Ionick,</hi> the other two of the <hi>Attick</hi> eloquence. As for <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> his <U+017F>tile is <U+017F>o particular, that there is none of the Ancients, to whom we can properly re<U+017F>emble him. And the rea<U+017F>on of this is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; for being conver<U+017F>ant in <U+017F>o great variety of Authors, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting from all of them, what he thought mo<U+017F>t excellent, out of the confu<U+017F>ion, or rather mixture of all their <U+017F>tiles, he form'd his own, which partaking of each, was yet none of them; but a compound of them all, like the <hi>Corinthian</hi> metal, which had
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47090:69"/>
in it Gold, and Bra<U+017F>s, and Silver, and yet was a <U+017F>pecies by its <U+017F>elf. Add to this, that in <hi>Plutarchs</hi> time, and long before it, the purity of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue was corrupted, and the native <U+017F>plendour of it had taken the tarni<U+017F>h of <hi>Barbari<U+017F>m,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the filth and <U+017F>pots of dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating Ages. For the fall of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires always draws after it the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Eloquence of the people: They, who labour under misfortunes or <U+017F>ervitude, have little lei<U+017F>ure to cultivate their mother Tongue: To conclude, when <hi>Athens</hi> had lo<U+017F>t her Soveraignity to the <hi>Peloponne<U+017F>ians,</hi> and her liberty to <hi>Philip,</hi> neither a <hi>Thucydides,</hi> nor a <hi>Demo<U+017F>thenes</hi> were afterwards produc'd by her.</p>
            <p>I have formerly acknowledg'd many lap<U+017F>es of our Author, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ion'd through his inadvertency, but he is likewi<U+017F>e tax'd with faults, which reflect on his Judgment in matters
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47090:70"/>
of fact, and his Candour in the compari<U+017F>ons of his <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Both which are <U+017F>o well vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by <hi>Montaign,</hi> that I need but barely to tran<U+017F>late him. <q>Fir<U+017F>t then he is accus'd of want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in reporting things incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: For proof of which is alledg'd the <U+017F>tory he tells of the <hi>Spartan</hi> boy, who <U+017F>uffer'd his bowels to be torn out by a young Fox which he had <U+017F>tolen, choo<U+017F>ing rather to hide him under his Garment till he died, then to confe<U+017F>s his robbery. In the fir<U+017F>t place this example is ill cho<U+017F>en, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e tis difficult to <U+017F>et a bound to the force of our internal faculties, tis not defin'd how far our re<U+017F>olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may carry us to <U+017F>uffer: The force of bodies may more ea<U+017F>ily be determin'd than that of Souls: Then of all people the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> by rea<U+017F>on of their rigid in<U+017F>titution, were mo<U+017F>t harden'd to undergo labours,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47090:70"/>
and to <U+017F>uffer pains. <hi>Cicero,</hi> before our Authors time, tho then the <hi>Spartan</hi> vertue was degenerated, yet avows to have <U+017F>een him<U+017F>elf <U+017F>ome <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> boys, who to make tryal of their patience, were plac'd before the Altar of <hi>Diana,</hi> where they endur'd <U+017F>courging, till they were all over bloody, and that not only without crying, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without a <U+017F>igh or groan: Nay, and <U+017F>ome of them <U+017F>o ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of this reputation, that they willingly re<U+017F>ign'd their Lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hands of their tormentors. The <U+017F>ame may be <U+017F>aid of another <U+017F>tory, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> vouches with an hundred witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, that in the time of Sacrifice, a burning coal by chance, falling into the <U+017F>leeve of a <hi>Spartan</hi> boy, who held the Cen<U+017F>er, he <U+017F>uffer'd his Arm to be <U+017F>corch'd <U+017F>o long without moving it, that the <U+017F>cent of it reak'd up

               <q>For my own part, who have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <U+017F>o va<U+017F>t an Idea of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian</hi> magnanimity, <hi>Plutarchs</hi> <U+017F>tory, is <U+017F>o far from <U+017F>eeming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to me, that I neither think it wonderful nor uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: For we ought not to mea<U+017F>ure po<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities or impo<U+017F><U+017F>ibilities by our own <U+017F>tandard, that is, by what we our <U+017F>elves cou'd do or <U+017F>uffer. The<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>ome other <U+017F>light ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, are made u<U+017F>e of, to le<U+017F><U+017F>en the opinion of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Judgment: But the common exception again<U+017F>t his candor, is, that in his parallels of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> he has done too much honour to his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in matching them with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, with whom they were not worthy to be compar'd. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tances of this, there are produc'd the compari<U+017F>ons of <hi>Demo<U+017F>thenes</hi>

For what proportion of glory is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a <hi>Roman Con<U+017F>ul,</hi> or <hi>Procon<U+017F>ul</hi> of <U+017F>o great a Common-wealth, and a <hi><U+017F>imple Citizen</hi> of <hi>Athens?</hi> But he who con<U+017F>iders the truth more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and weighs not honours with honours, but Men with Men, which was <hi>Plutarchs</hi> main de<U+017F>ign, will find in the Ballance of their manners, their vertues, their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and abilities, that <hi>Cicero</hi> and the <hi>Elder Cato,</hi> were far from having the overweight again<U+017F>t <hi>Demo<U+017F>thenes</hi> and <hi>Ari<U+017F>tides.</hi> I might as well complain again<U+017F>t him in behalf of his own Country-men: For neither was <hi>Camillus</hi> <U+017F>o famous

as <hi>Themi<U+017F>tocles;</hi> nor were <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Cajus Gracchus</hi> comparable to <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> in regard of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Much le<U+017F>s was the wi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Numa</hi> to be put in Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance again<U+017F>t that of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> or the mode<U+017F>ty and temperance of <hi>Scipio,</hi> again<U+017F>t the <U+017F>olid Philo<U+017F>ophy and perfect vertue of <hi>Epaminondas:</hi> Yet the di<U+017F>parity of victories, the reputation, the blaze of Glory, in the two la<U+017F>t were evidently on the <hi>Roman</hi> <U+017F>ide. But as I <U+017F>aid before, to compare them this way, was the lea<U+017F>t of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> aim; he openly declares again<U+017F>t it: For <U+017F>peaking of the cour<U+017F>e of <hi>Pompeys</hi> fortune, his exploits of War, the greatne<U+017F>s of the Armies which he commanded, the <U+017F>plendour and number of his Triumphs, in his compari<U+017F>on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and <hi>Age<U+017F>ilaus,</hi> I believe, <U+017F>ays he, that if <hi>Xenophon</hi> were now alive, and would indulge him<U+017F>elf

they <U+017F>eem truly to me very great; but I think he might have carried them yet farther, and have pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated more deeply into humane nature: There are folds and rece<U+017F><U+017F>es in our minds which have e<U+017F>cap'd him; he judges man too much in gro<U+017F>s; and thinks him not <U+017F>o diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as he is often from him<U+017F>elf: The <U+017F>ame per<U+017F>on being ju<U+017F>t, unju<U+017F>t, merciful, and cruel; which qualities <U+017F>eeming to bely each other in him, he Attributes their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>i<U+017F>tences to forreign cau<U+017F>es: Infine, if he had di<U+017F>crib'd <hi>Catiline,</hi> he wou'd have given him to us, either prodigal or Covetous: That <hi>alieni appetens <U+017F>ui profu<U+017F>us,</hi> was above his reach.

greate<U+017F>t Crimes: So that judging him in the whole, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him to have been naturally cruel, and prone to vengeance, but that he could remit of his <U+017F>everi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when his intere<U+017F>ts requir'd it.</q>

            <p>Here methinks our Author <U+017F>eems to have <U+017F>ufficiently under<U+017F>tood the folds and doubles of <hi>Sylla's</hi> di<U+017F>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ition; for his Character is full of variety, and incon<U+017F>i<U+017F>tences. Yet in the conclu<U+017F>ion, 'tis to be confe<U+017F>s'd that <hi>Plutarch</hi> has a<U+017F><U+017F>ign'd him a bloody nature: The clemency was but artificial and a<U+017F><U+017F>um'd, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty was inborn: But this cannot be <U+017F>aid of his rapine, and his prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for here the <hi>alieni appetens, <U+017F>ui profu<U+017F>us</hi> is as plainly de<U+017F>crib'd, as if <hi>Plutarch</hi> had borrow'd the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e from <hi>Salu<U+017F>t:</hi> And as he was a great Collector, perhaps he did.

he judg'd rightly of <hi>Sylla,</hi> that naturally he was cruel: For that quality was predominant in him; and he was oftener revengeful than he was merciful. But this is <U+017F>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to vindicate our Authors Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from being <U+017F>uperficial, and I de<U+017F>ire not to pre<U+017F>s the Argument more <U+017F>trongly again<U+017F>t this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who has Honour'd our Country by his long Re<U+017F>idence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong<U+017F>t us.</p>
            <p>It <U+017F>eems to me, I mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s that our Author has not been more hardly treated by his Enemies, in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring other Men, than he has been by his friends, in their comparing <hi>Seneca</hi> with him. And herein, even <hi>Montaign</hi> him<U+017F>elf is <U+017F>carcely to be defended. For no man more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>teem'd <hi>Plutarch,</hi> no man was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with his excellences, yet this notwith<U+017F>tanding, he has

done too great an honour to <hi>Seneca,</hi> by ranking him with our Philo<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher and Hi<U+017F>torian, him, I <U+017F>ay, who was <U+017F>o much le<U+017F>s a <hi>Philo<U+017F>opher,</hi> and no <hi>Hi<U+017F>torian:</hi> Tis a Reputation to <hi>Seneca,</hi> that any one has offer'd at the compari<U+017F>on: The worth of his Adver<U+017F>ary makes his defeat advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to him; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> might cry out with Ju<U+017F>tice; <hi>Qui cum victus erit, mecum certa<U+017F><U+017F>e feretur.</hi> If I had been to find out a parallel for <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> I <U+017F>hould rather have pitch'd on <hi>Varro</hi> the mo<U+017F>t learned of the <hi>Romans,</hi> if at lea<U+017F>t his Works had yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd; or with <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> if he had written.

as one who has overcome the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: <hi>Seneca</hi> is painful, as he who <U+017F>till labours under it. <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Vertue is humble and civiliz'd: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>'s haughty and illbred. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> allures you, <hi>Seneca</hi> commands you.

of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> than as a teacher of Morality. For my part I dare not pu<U+017F>h the commendation <U+017F>o far: His courage was perhas prai<U+017F>e wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, if he endeavour'd to deliver <hi>Rome</hi> from <U+017F>uch a Mon<U+017F>ter of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, as <hi>Nero</hi> was then beginning to appear: His ambition too was the more excu<U+017F>able, if he found in him<U+017F>elf an ability of governing the World, and a de<U+017F>ire of doing good to human kind: But as to his good fortunes with the Empre<U+017F>s, I know not what value ought to be <U+017F>et on a wi<U+017F>e Man for them. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be that Women generally liking without Judgment, it was a Conque<U+017F>t for a Philo<U+017F>opher once in an age, to get the better of a fool.

But let the Hi<U+017F>torian an<U+017F>wer for his own Relation: Only, if true, 'tis <U+017F>o much the wor<U+017F>e, that <hi>Seneca,</hi> after having abus'd his bed, cou'd not let him <U+017F>leep quiet in his grave.

tho he could Preach forgivene<U+017F>s to others, did not practice it him<U+017F>elf in that Satyr: Where was the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibility of a <hi>Stoick,</hi> in revenging his Bani<U+017F>hment with a Libel?

But the tallent of his malice is vi<U+017F>ible in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places: He cen<U+017F>ures <hi>Mecenas,</hi> and I believe ju<U+017F>tly, for the loo<U+017F>ene<U+017F>s of his manners, the voluptuou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of his life, and the effeminacy of his <U+017F>tyle; but it appears that he takes plea<U+017F>ure in <U+017F>o doing; and that he never forc'd his nature, when he <U+017F>poke ill of any Man.

and returnings that imitated the intricate windings of the Labyrinth. And this Dance, as <hi>Dicaearchus</hi> writes, is call'd among the Delians, The Crane.

which he indeed accepted of, but hung them upon his Heralds <U+017F>taff; and thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the Sea <U+017F>ide before <hi>The<U+017F>eus</hi> had fini<U+017F>h'd his libation to the Gods, he <U+017F>tay'd without, for fear of di<U+017F>turbing the holy Rites; but as <U+017F>oon as the Sacrifice was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he entred and related the whole <U+017F>tory of the King's Death: upon the hearing of which, with great lamentations and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<U+017F>ed tumult of grief they ran with all ha<U+017F>te to the City.

and in the heighth of his grief, an Oracle which he had formerly receiv'd at <hi>Delphos,</hi> came into his mind; for he had been commanded by the Prie<U+017F>te<U+017F>s of <hi>Apollo Pythius,</hi> that where-ever in his Travels he was mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>orrowful, and under the greate<U+017F>t affliction, he <U+017F>hould build a City there, and leave <U+017F>ome of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be Governours of the Place.

it: After the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who had taken <hi>Rome,</hi> were driven out by <hi>Camillus,</hi> and the City had not as yet recover'd her <U+017F>trength, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Latines,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Livius Po<U+017F>thumius,</hi> took this time to march again<U+017F>t her.

The <hi>Romans</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, they both dreaded a War, yet thought a Surrender of their Women little better than a meer Captivity. Being in this doubt, a Servant-maid call'd <hi>Philotis,</hi> (or as <U+017F>ome <U+017F>ay, <hi>Teutola)</hi> advis'd them to do neither, but rather, by a Stratagem, both to avoid Fighting, and the giving up of <U+017F>uch Pledges.

               <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> skreening it behind with Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Coverlets from the <U+017F>ight of the Enemy: But it was plain to the <hi>Romans:</hi> when they <U+017F>aw it, they ran furiou<U+017F>ly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of the Gates, ha<U+017F>tening one another what they could, <U+017F>o falling in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly upon the Enemy, they defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.

The other to e<U+017F>cape pre<U+017F>ent Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and a puni<U+017F>hment that threatned him, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Plato,)</hi> grew valiant purely out of fear; and dreading the extreame<U+017F>t Inflictions, attempted great Enterprizes out of meer nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity. Again, His greate<U+017F>t Action was only the killing of one King of <hi>Alba;</hi> whereas the by-Adventures and Preludes of the other were the Conque<U+017F>ts of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Scinnis, Procru<U+017F>tes</hi> and <hi>Corynetes;</hi> by reducing and killing of whom, he ridded <hi>Greece</hi> of very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Oppre<U+017F><U+017F>ors, before any of them that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, knew who did it; and he might then without any trouble as well have gone to <hi>Athens</hi> by Sea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>idering he him<U+017F>elf never was in the lea<U+017F>t injured by tho<U+017F>e Robbers; whereas <hi>Romulus</hi> could not but be in Action whil<U+017F>t <hi>Amulius</hi> lived. A great te<U+017F>timony of this is, that <hi>The<U+017F>eus,</hi> for no wrong done him<U+017F>elf, but for the <U+017F>ake of others, did fall upon the<U+017F>e Villains; but <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> as long as they them<U+017F>elves <U+017F>uffer'd no ill by the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, permitted him to opprefs all others. And if it be a great thing to have been wounded in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel by the <hi>Sabines,</hi> to have kill'd King <hi>Acron,</hi> and to have conquer'd many Enemies; we may oppo<U+017F>e to the<U+017F>e Actions, the Battel with the <hi>Centaurs,</hi> and the Feats done again<U+017F>t the <hi>Amazons.</hi> But what <hi>The<U+017F>eus</hi> adventur'd, in offering him<U+017F>elf vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily with the other young Boys and Virgins, as part of the Tribute into <hi>Crete,</hi> either to be a

Prey to a Mon<U+017F>ter, or a Victim upon the Tomb of <hi>Androgeus,</hi> or, what is lea<U+017F>t of all, to live vilely and di<U+017F>honourably in <U+017F>lavery to in<U+017F>ulting and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Men; a Man cannot expre<U+017F>s what an Act of Boldne<U+017F>s, or Courage, or Ju<U+017F>tice to the Publick, or of Honour and Bravery, that was. So that methinks the Philo<U+017F>ophers did not define Love ill, to be <hi>the <U+017F>ervice of the Gods in a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>ting and pre<U+017F>erving Youth;</hi> for the Love of <hi>Ariadne,</hi> above all, <U+017F>eems to be the proper work and de<U+017F>ign of <U+017F>ome God, in order to pre<U+017F>erve <hi>The<U+017F>eus;</hi> and indeed we ought not to blame her for loving him, but rather won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Men and Women were not alike affected towards him; and if <U+017F>he alone were <U+017F>o, truly I dare pronounce her worthy of the Love of a God, who was her <U+017F>elf <U+017F>o great a Lover of Vertue and Goodne<U+017F>s, and the brave<U+017F>t Man.</p>

For a Prince's chief end is to pre<U+017F>erve his Empire, which is done no le<U+017F>s by avoiding Indecencies, than by maintaining a deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in all things: Who-ever is either too remi<U+017F>s or too <U+017F>trict in this, is no more a King or a Prince, but either too popular a Man, or too lordly, and <U+017F>o becomes either odious or contemptible to his Subjects. This <U+017F>eems to be the fault of Ea<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s and good Nature, the other of Pride and Severity; but if we mu<U+017F>t not in all re<U+017F>pects impute Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to the Fates, but con<U+017F>ider in them the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of mens Manners and Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ions, as the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onable and incon<U+017F>iderate effects of Wrath and Anger, a Man can neither excu<U+017F>e one in his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to his Brother, nor the other to his Son.

it proceeded from a greater Cau<U+017F>e, as being <U+017F>truck with the <U+017F>everer La<U+017F>h. <hi>Romulus,</hi> having di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed with his Brother, advi<U+017F>edly and deliberately upon the Concerns of the Publick, one would think, he could not of the <U+017F>udden have been put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <U+017F>o great pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion; but Love, and Jealou<U+017F>ie, and the Complaints of his Wife, (which few Men can avoid being provoked with) <U+017F>educed <hi>The<U+017F>eus</hi> to commit that Outrage upon his Son. And what is more, <hi>Romulus</hi> in his Anger committed an Action of mo<U+017F>t unfortunate Con<U+017F>equence; but that of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>eus</hi> ended only in words, <U+017F>ome evil-<U+017F>peaking, and a few old Peoples Cur<U+017F>es, the re<U+017F>t of the Youth's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ery <U+017F>eems to proceed from Fortune; <U+017F>o that <U+017F>o far a Man would give his Vote on <hi>The<U+017F>eus</hi>'s part. But the chiefe<U+017F>t matter in the other is this, that his Performances proceeded from very <U+017F>mall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings; for both the Brothers being thought Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and the Sons of Swineherds, before they were Free-men them<U+017F>elves, they gave liberty to almo<U+017F>t all the <hi>Latines,</hi> obtaining at once all the mo<U+017F>t ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Titles, as de<U+017F>troyers of their Countreys Enemies, pre<U+017F>ervers of their Friends and Kindred, Princes of the People, Founders, not removers of Cities; for <U+017F>uch an one was <hi>The<U+017F>eus,</hi> who rai<U+017F>ed and compiled only one Hou<U+017F>e out of many, demoli<U+017F>hing many Cities bearing the Names of ancient Kings and Heroes.

he <U+017F>lew not, but he <U+017F>ubdued Nations, he overthrew Cities, he triumph'd over Kings and Princes; and as to <hi>Remus,</hi> it is doubtful by who<U+017F>e Hand he was cut off, it is generally imputed to others. His Mother he apparently retriev'd from death, and placed his Grandfather, who was brought under ba<U+017F>e and di<U+017F>honourable Va<U+017F><U+017F>alage, in the ancient Throne of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> to whom he did voluntarily many good Offices, but never annoyed him, no not through ignorance it <U+017F>elf.

And that it was the Cau<U+017F>e of Reverence, and Love, and Con<U+017F>tancy in Matrimony, time can witne<U+017F>s; for in 230 years neither any Husband de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erted his Wife, nor any Wife her Husband; but, as the mo<U+017F>t curious among the <hi>Graecians</hi> can tell you the fir<U+017F>t Parricide, <U+017F>o the <hi>Romans</hi> all well know, that <hi>Spurius Carvilius</hi> was the fir<U+017F>t who put away his Wife, accu<U+017F>ing her of Barrenne<U+017F>s.

            <p>THere is <U+017F>o much incertainty in the accounts which Hi<U+017F>torians have left us of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> the Law giver of <hi>Sparta,</hi> that <U+017F>carcely any thing is a<U+017F><U+017F>erted by one of them which is not call'd into que<U+017F>tion, or contradicted by the re<U+017F>t. Their <U+017F>entiments are quite different as to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily he came of, the Voyages he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, the place, and manner of his death, but mo<U+017F>t of all when they <U+017F>peak of the Laws

They cannot by any means be brought to an agreement as to the very Age in which this excellent per<U+017F>on liv'd: for <U+017F>ome of them <U+017F>ay that he flouri<U+017F>hed in the time of <hi>Iphitus,</hi> and that they two jointly contrived the Ordinance for the ce<U+017F><U+017F>ation of Arms during the Solemnity of the <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick</hi> Games.

power of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h'd an hundred and thirty years after the death of <hi>Lycurgus. Elatus</hi> was the fir<U+017F>t who had this dignity conferr'd upon him, in the reign of King <hi>Theopompus,</hi> whom when his Queen upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one day, that he would leave the regal power to his Children le<U+017F>s than him<U+017F>elf had received it from his Ance<U+017F>tours, he told her that <U+017F>he was much mi<U+017F>taken, for he <U+017F>hould leave it <U+017F>o much greater than he found it, by how much it was more likely to la<U+017F>t. For indeed the Prerogative being thus kept within <U+017F>ome rea<U+017F>onable bounds, <hi>at once</hi> he freed him<U+017F>elf from the envy, and <U+017F>ecur'd him<U+017F>elf from the danger, to which an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited juri<U+017F>diction lies expo<U+017F>ed. So that the Spartan Kings fared much better after it than their neighbours at <hi>Me<U+017F><U+017F>ene</hi> and <hi>Argos;</hi> who by <U+017F>crewing their Prerogative too high, crack'd it, and for want of yielding a little to the populacy, lo<U+017F>t all.</p>
            <p>Indeed, who<U+017F>oever <U+017F>hall take a pro<U+017F>pect of the Seditions and civil Wars which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell the<U+017F>e bordering Nations, (to whom they were as near related in bloud as <U+017F>ituation) will find good rea<U+017F>on to admire the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found wi<U+017F>edom and providence of <hi>Lycurgus;</hi> for the<U+017F>e three States in their fir<U+017F>t ri<U+017F>e were equal, or, if there were any odds they lay on the <U+017F>ide of the Me<U+017F><U+017F>enians and Argives, who in the deci<U+017F>ion of the Country were more
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47090:157"/>
fortunate than the Spartans: yet was their flouri<U+017F>h but of <U+017F>mall continuance, <U+017F>oon fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into confu<U+017F>ion, partly by the tyrannical di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition of their Kings, and partly by the ungovernablene<U+017F>s of the people: <U+017F>o that now their <U+017F>ervile and di<U+017F>gracefull condition makes it appear to the whole world, that it is one of the greate<U+017F>t ble<U+017F><U+017F>ings which heaven can <U+017F>end down upon any Nation, to give them <U+017F>o wi<U+017F>e a Law-giver who could <U+017F>et bounds to tho<U+017F>e two inter<U+017F>ering powers, and of <U+017F>uch jarring elements frame an orderly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. But of this I <U+017F>hall <U+017F>ay more in its due place.</p>
            <p>After the creation of the thirty Senatours his next task, and indeed the mo<U+017F>t hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous he ever undertook, was the making a new divi<U+017F>ion of their Lands. For there was a very <U+017F>trange inequality among<U+017F>t the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Sparta,</hi> <U+017F>o that the City was <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with a multitude of beggarly and nece<U+017F><U+017F>itous per<U+017F>ons, whil<U+017F>t the Lands and Money were engro<U+017F><U+017F>ed by a few: therefore to the end that he might bani<U+017F>h out of the State Luxury and Arrogance (the vices of the rich,) and Envy and Knavery, (the u<U+017F>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al faults of the poor) and the <U+017F>ource of all mi<U+017F>chiefs, Want and Superfluity, he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of them to renounce their properties, and to con<U+017F>ent to a new divi<U+017F>ion of the Land: that they <U+017F>hould live all with the equality
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47090:157"/>
and friendline<U+017F>s of co-heirs and Brothers: <U+017F>o that there being no other way left to mount to a degree of eminence above the re<U+017F>t than to become more valiant and more vertuous than they, <hi>ambition began to be a good <U+017F>ubject,</hi> and <U+017F>et men upon the u<U+017F>e of tho<U+017F>e means by which true honour is to be acquir'd.</p>
            <p>Having got their con<U+017F>ent to his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>als he immediately put them in execution: and having exactly <U+017F>urvey'd the whole Country of <hi>Laconia,</hi> he divided it into thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thou<U+017F>and equal <U+017F>hares, and the Liberties of the City of <hi>Sparta</hi> into nine thou<U+017F>and, and the<U+017F>e he di<U+017F>tributed to the Inhabitants of the City, as he did the others to them who dwelt in the Country. Some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours <U+017F>ay that he made but <U+017F>ix thou<U+017F>and lots for the Citizens of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and that King <hi>Polydore</hi> added three thou<U+017F>and more. Others <U+017F>ay that <hi>Polydore</hi> doubled the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had made, which (according to them) was but four thou<U+017F>and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. A lot was <U+017F>o much as to yield one year with another about <U+017F>eventy Bu<U+017F>hels of Grain, for the Ma<U+017F>ter of the Family, and twelve for his Wife, with a <U+017F>utable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Oil and Wine. And this he thought <U+017F>ufficient to keep their bodies in good health and lu<U+017F>ty, and as for <U+017F>uperfluities he de<U+017F>ign'd wholly to retrench them. It is reported
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47090:158"/>
that as he returned from a Journey <U+017F>ome time after the divi<U+017F>ion of the Lands, in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>t time, the ground being newly reap'd, ob<U+017F>erving the Sheaves to be all equal, and the Shocks of the <U+017F>ame bigne<U+017F>s, he <U+017F>miling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>aid to tho<U+017F>e about him, methinks <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemon</hi> is like the inheritance of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Brothers, which have newly made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ion among<U+017F>t them<U+017F>elves.</p>
            <p>Not contented with this, he re<U+017F>olv'd to make a divi<U+017F>ion of their Movables too, that there might be no odious di<U+017F>tinction or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality left among<U+017F>t them; but finding that it would be very dangerous to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it openly, he bethought him<U+017F>elf of this <U+017F>tratagem. He commanded that all Gold and Silver Coin <U+017F>hould be cry'd down, and that onely a <U+017F>ort of Money made of Iron <U+017F>hould be current, whereof a great weight and quantity was but very little worth: <U+017F>o that to lay up twenty or thirty pounds there was requir'd a pretty large Chamber, and to remove it, nothing le<U+017F>s than a yoke of Oxen. By this invention, it is <U+017F>carcely to be imagin'd, how many exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Vices were bani<U+017F>h'd <hi>Lacedaemon:</hi> for who would rob another of <U+017F>uch a <U+017F>curvy <U+017F>ort of Coin? who would inju<U+017F>tly detein it? who would cheat and circumvent, be brib'd or turn Knight of the Po<U+017F>t to compa<U+017F>s it? when that it was not ea<U+017F>ie to be hid
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47090:158"/>
when a man had it, nor brought a man any credit in the world by the po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ion of it, nor could <U+017F>erve for any u<U+017F>e when you had cut it in pieces: for when it was red hot and ju<U+017F>t <U+017F>tamp'd, they quench'd it in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and by that means made it almo<U+017F>t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malleable by its hardne<U+017F>s.</p>
            <p>In the next place he bani<U+017F>h'd all Arts that were not ab<U+017F>olutely nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary; but here he might almo<U+017F>t have <U+017F>par'd his Proclamation: for they of them<U+017F>elves would have gone after the Gold and Silver, the money which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd being not <U+017F>o proper payment for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Pieces: for being of Iron it was <U+017F>carce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly portable, neither if they <U+017F>hould take <U+017F>o much pains as to export it, would it pa<U+017F>s among<U+017F>t the other Grecians, who were <U+017F>o far from valuing it that they thought it one of the mo<U+017F>t ridiculous things in the world. Thus was foreign Traffick almo<U+017F>t utterly cut off, for neither could the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans buy any Merchandi<U+017F>e of Strangers, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did any Merchants think it worth the while to bring in their Goods to any part of <hi>Laconia.</hi> For the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on, they were not pe<U+017F>tered with any <hi>pedantical</hi> Teachers of Rhetorick, with Gyp<U+017F>ies, Fortune-tellers, and Calculatours of Nativities; No pimping corrupters of youth brought their Ladies of compo<U+017F>ition, or their Boys to be unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abus'd there; no Gold-<U+017F>miths and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravers,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47090:159"/>
no Jewellers and Perfumers were to be found among<U+017F>t them, <hi>for there was no money:</hi> <U+017F>o that Luxury being depriv'd of that which fed and fomented it (being quite <U+017F>tarv'd out) was forc'd to quit their Country, and <U+017F>eek it <U+017F>elf one el<U+017F>ewhere. For the rich had no preeminence here over the poor, and their riches and abundance, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no opportunity of appearing and boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ting of it <U+017F>elf in publick, were forced to remain u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s at home, a <hi>co<U+017F>tly prey</hi> to the ru<U+017F>t and the moth. Their thoughts being thus taken off from things <U+017F>uperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they became excellent Arti<U+017F>ts in tho<U+017F>e which were nece<U+017F><U+017F>ary: <U+017F>o that Bed<U+017F>teads, Chairs and Tables, and <U+017F>uch like <U+017F>taple U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<U+017F>ils in a Family, were admirably well made there: particularly their Cup was very much in fa<U+017F>hion, and bought up by Souldiers, as <hi>Critias</hi> reports, for the colour and thickne<U+017F>s of the Cup hindred the mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine<U+017F>s of the dirty water (which upon mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches mu<U+017F>t often be drunk) from being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: and the figure of it was <U+017F>uch that the mud <U+017F>ank to the bottom, or <U+017F>tuck to the <U+017F>ides, <U+017F>o that onely the pure<U+017F>t part of the water came to the mouth of him that drank in it. And this skill of theirs, though in minute things, was mainly owing to their Law-giver, who took off their minds from the endle<U+017F>s care of providing the

means and in<U+017F>truments of Luxury, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend onely to tho<U+017F>e things which were of daily and indi<U+017F>pen<U+017F>able u<U+017F>e.</p>

            <p>This la<U+017F>t Ordinance bore very hard upon the wealthier <U+017F>ort of men, <U+017F>o that being out of all patience they made an in<U+017F>urrection again<U+017F>t <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and from ill words came to blows, <U+017F>o that at length he was forced to run out of the A<U+017F><U+017F>embly, and make to Sanctuary to <U+017F>ave his life: by good hap he got before all the re<U+017F>t, excepting one <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> (a young Gentleman otherwi<U+017F>e not ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli<U+017F>h'd, but too ha<U+017F>ty and cholerick) who

            <p>One branch then of the <hi>Rhetra</hi> was that their Laws <U+017F>hould not be written, another branch of it is particularly levell'd again<U+017F>t Luxury and expen<U+017F>ivene<U+017F>s: for by it it was ordained, That the Ceilings of their Hou<U+017F>es <U+017F>hould onely be wrought by the Ax, and their Gates and Doors <U+017F>mooth'd onely by

And this was not without my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tery: for if <hi>Epaminondas</hi> could <U+017F>ay with <U+017F>o good a grace, inviting <U+017F>ome Friends to his Table, <hi>Come, Gentlemen, be <U+017F>ecure, Trea<U+017F>on would never come to <U+017F>uch a poor Dinner as this;</hi> why might not this great Law-giver in all probability have thought that <U+017F>uch ill-favour'd Hou<U+017F>es would never be capable of receiving Luxury and <U+017F>uperfluity? For a man mu<U+017F>t have a more than ordinary <U+017F>hare of folly that would furni<U+017F>h <U+017F>uch Rooms with embroidered Beds, and Hangings of Arras, that would be <U+017F>erv'd in Plate upon a rough-hewn Table, and pretend to <hi>pomp</hi> and <hi>magnificence</hi> in a Hou<U+017F>e which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<U+017F>t too narrow for the <hi>nece<U+017F><U+017F>ities</hi> of life.

It is reported that King <hi>Leotichidas,</hi> the fir<U+017F>t of that name, was <U+017F>o little u<U+017F>ed to the <U+017F>ight of carv'd Work, that, being entertain'd at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> in a <U+017F>tately Room, he was much <U+017F>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd to <U+017F>ee the Timber and Ceiling <U+017F>o fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought, and asked his Ho<U+017F>t, <hi>whether the Trees grew <U+017F>o in his Country?</hi>

            <p>A third Ordinance of this forementioned <hi>Rhetra</hi> was, That they <U+017F>hould not make War often, or long, with the <U+017F>ame Enemy,

le<U+017F>t that they <U+017F>hould train and in<U+017F>truct them in the art of War by having often to doe with them: and by forcing them to defend them<U+017F>elves, at length teach them to be the aggre<U+017F><U+017F>ours: and for breaking this Law was <hi>Age<U+017F>ilaus</hi> much blamed a long time after, by making <U+017F>uch continual incur<U+017F>ions into <hi>Boeotia,</hi> that at length he taught that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make head again<U+017F>t the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: and therefore <hi>Antalcidas,</hi> <U+017F>eeing him wounded one day, <U+017F>aid to him, that he was very well paid for making the Thebans good Souldiers whether they would or no. And the<U+017F>e Laws were called the <hi>Rhetra,</hi> that is to <U+017F>ay, not inventions of Man's Wi<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but Divine Sanctions and Revelations from Heaven.</p>
            <p>In order to the good Education of their Youth (which, as I <U+017F>aid before, he thought the mo<U+017F>t important and noble<U+017F>t Work of a Law-giver) he went <U+017F>o far back as to take into con<U+017F>ideration their very Conception and Birth, by regulating their Marriages.

made them<U+017F>elves ab<U+017F>olute Mi<U+017F>tre<U+017F><U+017F>es at home, and would be treated with as much re<U+017F>pect as if they had been <U+017F>o many Queens. But by his good leave it is a mi<U+017F>take; for he took for that Sex too all the care that was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible: for an in<U+017F>tance of it he ordered the Maidens to exerci<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves with Wre<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Running, throwing the Bar and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ting the Dart, to the end that the Fruit they conceived might take deeper root, and grow <U+017F>trong, and <U+017F>pread it <U+017F>elf in <U+017F>trong and healthy Bodies; and withall that they might be the more able to undergo the pains of Child-bearing. And to the end he might take away their over-great tenderne<U+017F>s, and that <hi>acquired</hi> womani<U+017F>hne<U+017F>s which vain cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tom hath added to the <hi>natural,</hi> he ordered that they <U+017F>hould go naked as well as the young Men, and dance too in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at their <U+017F>olemn Fea<U+017F>ts and Sacrifices, <U+017F>inging certain Songs, whil<U+017F>t the young Men <U+017F>tood in a ring about them, <U+017F>eeing and hearing them: in the<U+017F>e Songs they now and then gave a <U+017F>atyrical glance upon tho<U+017F>e who had mi<U+017F>-behaved them<U+017F>elves in the Wars; and <U+017F>ometimes <U+017F>ang encomiums up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tho<U+017F>e who had done any gallant action, and by the<U+017F>e means enflamed the younger <U+017F>ort with an emulation of their glory.

Now though it may <U+017F>eem <U+017F>trange that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <U+017F>hould appear thus naked in publick, yet may it be <U+017F>aid that <hi>true</hi> mode<U+017F>ty was ob<U+017F>erv'd and wantonne<U+017F>s excluded; they were <U+017F>ufficiently clad in their <hi>native</hi> innocence and <U+017F>implicity, and wore the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the lovely original couple. The end of their exerci<U+017F>e was to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elves more active and vigorous, to the end that they might bear away the prize one from another, and at la<U+017F>t come to di<U+017F>pute it with the Men.

            <p>To return to the Lacedemonians. Their di<U+017F>cipline and order of life continued <U+017F>till after they were full grown men. No one was allowed to live after his own fancy; but the whole City re<U+017F>embled a great Camp in which every man had his <U+017F>hare of provi<U+017F>ions, and bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s <U+017F>et out, and look'd upon him<U+017F>elf not <U+017F>o much born to <U+017F>erve his own ends as the intere<U+017F>t of his Country.

but declare my opinion, that one of the greate<U+017F>t ble<U+017F><U+017F>ings <hi>Lycurgus</hi> procur'd to his people was, the abundance of lei<U+017F>ure, which proceeded from his forbidding to them the exerci<U+017F>e of any mean and mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Trade; for it was but lo<U+017F>t labour to wa<U+017F>te them<U+017F>elves with anxiety and toil to heap together a great deal of money, which when they had got was but u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s lumber in their hou<U+017F>e; for the <hi>Ilotes</hi> till'd their ground for them, and paid them yearly in kind the quantity above-mention'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble of theirs.

For tho<U+017F>e who had been builders of the City with <hi>Romulus,</hi> though they had already yielded a <U+017F>hare of their Lands and

On the other <U+017F>ide the Sabines alledged, that their King <hi>Tatius</hi> being decea<U+017F>ed, they had pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably <U+017F>ubmitted to the obedience of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> <U+017F>o that now their turn was come to have a King cho<U+017F>en out of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor did they e<U+017F>teem them<U+017F>elves infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Romans, nor to have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted le<U+017F>s than they to the increa<U+017F>e of <hi>Rome,</hi> which without their numbers and a<U+017F><U+017F>ociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could never have merited the name of a City.</p>
            <p>Thus did both parties argue and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their cau<U+017F>e; but le<U+017F>t in the mean time Sedition and di<U+017F>cord <U+017F>hould occa<U+017F>ion Anarchy and confu<U+017F>ion in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; it was agreed and ordained, That the hundred and fifty Senatours <U+017F>hould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeably execute the Office of <U+017F>upreme Magi<U+017F>trate, and with all the formalities and rites of Regality offer the <U+017F>olemn Sacrifices, and di<U+017F>patch judicial Cau<U+017F>es for the <U+017F>pace of <U+017F>ix hours by day and <U+017F>ix by night; the which vici<U+017F><U+017F>itude and equal di<U+017F>tribution of power would remove all emulation from among<U+017F>t the Senatours, and envy from the people; when they could behold one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to the degree of a King, levelled in a few hours after, to the private condition of

In pur<U+017F>uance of this agreement the Sabines remitted the choice to the ancient Romans, being more inclinable to receive a Sabine King elected by the Romans, than to <U+017F>ee a Roman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted by the Sabines: con<U+017F>ultations being accordingly held, <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> of the Sabine race, was elected; a per<U+017F>on <U+017F>o fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and of that high reputation, that <note place="margin">Numa <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>en King.</hi>
               </note> though he were not actually re<U+017F>iding at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet no <U+017F>ooner was he nominated than accepted by the Sabines with applau<U+017F>e and

acclamation, equal to that freedom which the Romans <U+017F>hewed in his election.</p>
            <p>The choice being declared and made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, principal men of both parties, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to compliment and intreat the Prince, that he would be plea<U+017F>ed to accept the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini<U+017F>tration of the Kingly Government. Now this <hi>Numa</hi> re<U+017F>ided at a famous City of the Sabines called <hi>Cures,</hi> whence both the Romans and Sabines gave them<U+017F>elves the name of <hi>Quirites,</hi> as a comprehen<U+017F>ive <note place="margin">

Thus whil<U+017F>t he bani<U+017F>hed all luxury and <U+017F>oftne<U+017F>s from his own home, he gave a clear and manife<U+017F>t indication to all Citizens and <U+017F>trangers of his <U+017F>ound and impartial judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not delighting him<U+017F>elf in diverti<U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or profitable acqui<U+017F>itions, but in the wor<U+017F>hip of the immortal Gods, and in the rational contemplation of their Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Nature; to all which renown and fame, he added this farther glory, that he took <hi>Tatia</hi> for his Wife, who was the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">

            <p>But, to pa<U+017F>s by the<U+017F>e matters, which are full of uncertainty, and not <U+017F>o important as to be worth our time to in<U+017F>i<U+017F>t long on; we <U+017F>hall proceed to things more pertinent, and <U+017F>hew, that the original con<U+017F>titution of Prie<U+017F>ts, which are called <hi>Pontifices,</hi> is a<U+017F>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <note place="margin">Numa <hi>fir<U+017F>t con<U+017F>tituted the</hi> Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> unto <hi>Numa,</hi> and that he him<U+017F>elf, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating in the fir<U+017F>t and primary Order, took upon him<U+017F>elf the name of <hi>Pontifex,</hi> or High Prie<U+017F>t; a<U+017F><U+017F>uming that title of <hi>Potens,</hi> or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, as if tho<U+017F>e, who<U+017F>e Office obliged them to an attendance on the Gods, were endued with a <U+017F>uper-eminent power and arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above all others: <U+017F>ome will have this name to be given by way of <U+017F>uper-excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as to a <U+017F>ole Moderatour, in who<U+017F>e power it is to ordain and appoint the times when Sacrifices and Divine Services are to be performed.

               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:47090:198"/>
and <hi>Athens,</hi> onely with this difference, that here it was con<U+017F>erved by Virgins but there by Widows, who were pa<U+017F>t the years and de<U+017F>ires of Marriage; and in ca<U+017F>e by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accident it <U+017F>hould happen, that this Fire became extinct, as the holy Lamp was at <hi>Athens,</hi> under the tyranny of <hi>Ari<U+017F>tion,</hi> and at <hi>Delphos,</hi> when that Temple was burnt by the Medes, and at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of the War with <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and of their own civil di<U+017F><U+017F>entions, when not onely the Fire was extingui<U+017F>hed but the Altar demoli<U+017F>hed: and then afterwads to kindle this Fire again it was e<U+017F>teemed an impiety to light it from the common <U+017F>parks or flame, but from the pure and unpolluted rays of the Sun; the which they performed by an In<U+017F>trument framed of three equal angles, which being placed in oppo<U+017F>ition to the Sun, collects the rays into one centre, and <U+017F>o attenuates the air, that it immediately gives fire to any combu<U+017F>tible matter from the inten<U+017F>e reflexion and reverberation of the Sun beams.

            <p>The Statutes pre<U+017F>cribed by <hi>Numa</hi> for the <note place="margin">The Laws appointed for the Ve<U+017F>tal Virgins.</note> Ve<U+017F>tals were the<U+017F>e.

Thus the whole term being compleated, it was lawfull for them to marry, and leaving then the <U+017F>acred Order, they were at liberty to choo<U+017F>e <U+017F>uch a condition of life as did mo<U+017F>t indulge, and was gratefull to their own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: but this permi<U+017F><U+017F>ion few (as they <U+017F>ay) made u<U+017F>e of; becau<U+017F>e it was ob<U+017F>erved, that their change of life was never accompanied with contentment, being ever after <U+017F>ad and melancholy; for which rea<U+017F>on they confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them<U+017F>elves untill old age and the hour of

            <p>But this <U+017F>evere condition was recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed <note place="margin">Their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</note> by other privileges and prerogatives; as that they had power to make a Te<U+017F>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the life-time of their Father, that they had a free admini<U+017F>tration of their own affairs without Guardian or Tutor, which was the privilege of women who were the Mothers of three Children: when they went abroad they had the <hi>Fa<U+017F>ces</hi> carried before them; and if perchance in their walks abroad it were their fortune to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter a Malefactour leading to execution, they had the privilege to free him from death; upon oath made, that the occa<U+017F>ion was accidental and not de<U+017F>igned or of <U+017F>et purpo<U+017F>e. Who<U+017F>oever pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed upon the Chair on which they were carried was guilty of a capital crime, and immediately puni<U+017F>hed with death. If the<U+017F>e Ve<U+017F>tals committed any faults they were puni<U+017F>hable by the High Prie<U+017F>t onely, who, as the nature of the offence required, whipped them naked in a dark place, and under the caution of a Veil or Curtain; but <U+017F>he that had been defiled, or permitted her <U+017F>elf to be deflou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was buried alive near the Gate which is called <hi>Collina;</hi> where a little mount of Earth is rai<U+017F>ed, called in Latin <hi>Agger;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is a narrow Room, to which a de<U+017F>cent

is made by Stairs: here they prepare a Bed, and light up a Lamp, and provide a <U+017F>mall quantity of Victuals, <U+017F>uch as Bread, Water in a Bottle, Milk and Oil; that <U+017F>o that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which had been con<U+017F>ecrated and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the mo<U+017F>t divine and my<U+017F>terious <U+017F>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, might not be <U+017F>aid to peri<U+017F>h by a death <U+017F>o dete<U+017F>table as that of Famine. The party thus condemned, is carried to execution through the Market-place in a Litter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <U+017F>he is covered and bound with Cords, <U+017F>o that the voice of her cries and laments can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be heard; all people with <U+017F>ilence go out of the way as <U+017F>he pa<U+017F><U+017F>es, and <U+017F>uch as follow accompany the Bier with <U+017F>olemn and tacite <U+017F>orrow; and indeed <U+017F>uch is the <U+017F>adne<U+017F>s which the City puts on on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<U+017F>ion, that there is no <U+017F>pectacle of grief which appears of more common and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concernment than this. When they come to the place of Execution, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers loo<U+017F>e the Cords, and then the High Prie<U+017F>t, lifting his hands to Heaven, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mures <U+017F>ome certain prayers to him<U+017F>elf, then the Pri<U+017F>oner being <U+017F>till covered is brought forth, and led down by the <U+017F>teps unto her Hou<U+017F>e of darkne<U+017F>s; which being done, the Prie<U+017F>ts retire, and the Stairs being drawn up, the Earth is pre<U+017F><U+017F>ed and crouded in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Vault is filled. And this was the puni<U+017F>hment of tho<U+017F>e who broke their Vow
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47090:200"/>
of Virginity. It is <U+017F>aid al<U+017F>o that <hi>Numa</hi> built the Temple of <hi>Ve<U+017F>ta,</hi> which was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a con<U+017F>ervatory of the Holy Fire, in an orbicular form, to repre<U+017F>ent perhaps the Frame of the Univer<U+017F>e, in the centre of which the Pythagoreans place the element of Fire, and give it the name of <hi>Ve<U+017F>ta</hi> and Unity: and yet they do not hold that the Earth is immovable, or that it is <U+017F>ituated in the middle region of the Globe; but keeps a circular motion about the <U+017F>eat of Fire: nor do they account the Earth among<U+017F>t the chief or primary Elements; following the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> who, they <U+017F>ay, in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and philo<U+017F>ophical age, held that the Earth had a lateral po<U+017F>ition, for that the middle or centre was re<U+017F>erved for <U+017F>ome more noble and refined Body.</p>
            <p>There was yet a farther u<U+017F>e of the High Prie<U+017F>t, and that was to order the Proce<U+017F><U+017F>ion at funeral Rites, according to the method pre<U+017F>cribed by <hi>Numa,</hi> who taught, that there was no uncleanne<U+017F>s in the contact of dead Corp<U+017F>es, but a part of the <U+017F>ervice owing to the <U+017F>ubterranean Gods: among<U+017F>t which they wor<U+017F>hipped the Godde<U+017F>s <hi>Libitina</hi> as the chief of tho<U+017F>e who pre<U+017F>ided over the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies performed at Burials; whether they meant hereby <hi>Per<U+017F>ephone,</hi> or (as <U+017F>ome of the learned Romans will have it) <hi>Venus,</hi> for they, not without good rea<U+017F>on, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the beginning and end of Man's li<U+017F>e to the <U+017F>ame original cau<U+017F>e and virtue of a Deity.</p>

               <hi>Numa</hi> al<U+017F>o pre<U+017F>cribed Rules for regulating the days of Mourning, according to certain <note place="margin">The regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> times and ages. As for example, a Child of three years, and <U+017F>o upwards to ten, was to be mourned for, for <U+017F>o many months as it was years old; and the longe<U+017F>t time of mourning for any per<U+017F>on what<U+017F>oever was not to exceed the term of ten months: which al<U+017F>o was the time appointed unto Widows to lament the lo<U+017F>s of their decea<U+017F>ed Husbands; before which they could not without great indecency pa<U+017F>s unto <U+017F>econd Marriages; but in ca<U+017F>e their incontinence was <U+017F>uch as could not admit <U+017F>o long an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tinence from the Marriage-bed, they were then to <U+017F>acrifice a Cow with Calf for expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their fault.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Numa</hi> al<U+017F>o was Founder of <U+017F>everal other Orders of Prie<U+017F>ts; two of which are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be here mentioned, namely the <hi>Salii</hi> and the <hi>Feciales,</hi> which, with other in<U+017F>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are clear proofs of the great devotion and <U+017F>anctity of this Per<U+017F>on.

               <note place="margin">Feciales, <hi>an Order of Prie<U+017F>ts, whence <U+017F>o <U+017F>tyled.</hi>
               </note> who<U+017F>e name in my opinion is derived from their Office, were the Arbitratours to whom all Controver<U+017F>ies were referred rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to War and Peace; for it was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable to take up Arms untill they had
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47090:201"/>
declared all hopes and expedients rejected which tended to an accommodation; by the word Peace, we mean a determination of matters in di<U+017F>pute by Law, and not by Violence or Force. The Romans common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly di<U+017F>patched the <hi>Feciales,</hi> who were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Heralds, to tho<U+017F>e who had offered them injury, requiring <U+017F>atisfaction; and in ca<U+017F>e they made not re<U+017F>titution or ju<U+017F>t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, they then called the Gods to witne<U+017F>s again<U+017F>t them and their Country, and <U+017F>o de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced War: the <U+017F>en<U+017F>e of the <hi>Feciales</hi> in this ca<U+017F>e was of ab<U+017F>olute nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their con<U+017F>ent it was neither lawfull for the Roman King, nor yet for the people to take up Arms; and from them the General took his rules concerning the ju<U+017F>tice of his cau<U+017F>e, which being adjudged, and the War determined; the next bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s was to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate of the manner and ways to manage and carry it on. It is believed, that the <U+017F>laughter and de<U+017F>truction which the Gauls made of the Romans, was a ju<U+017F>t judgment on the City for neglect of this religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: for that when a foreign Nation be<U+017F>ieged the Clu<U+017F>inians, <hi>Fabius Ambu<U+017F>tus</hi> was di<U+017F>patched to their Camp with Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>itions of Peace; but they returning a rude and peremptory An<U+017F>wer thereunto, <hi>Fabius</hi> imagined that his Treaty was at an end, and that he had fully complied with the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47090:201"/>
duty of his Emba<U+017F><U+017F>ie; and therefore ra<U+017F>hly engaging in a War, challenged the <U+017F>toute<U+017F>t and brave<U+017F>t of the enemy to a <U+017F>ingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. It was the fortune of <hi>Fabius</hi> to kill his adver<U+017F>ary and to take his <U+017F>poils, which when the Gauls under<U+017F>tood, they <U+017F>ent a Herald to <hi>Rome</hi> to complain again<U+017F>t <hi>Fabius,</hi> who, before a War was publi<U+017F>hed, had, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<U+017F>t the Law of Nations, made a breach of the Peace. The matter being debated in the Senate, the <hi>Feciales</hi> were of opinion, that <hi>Fabius</hi> ought to be con<U+017F>igned into the hands of the Gauls; but he, being pre-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<U+017F>ed of this judgment, fled to the people, by who<U+017F>e protection and favour he was <U+017F>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured: on this occa<U+017F>ion, the Gauls marched with their Army to <hi>Rome,</hi> where, having taken the Capitol, they <U+017F>acked the City. The particulars of all which are at large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the Hi<U+017F>tory of <hi>Camillus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the original of the <hi>Salii</hi> is this: In the eighth year of the reign of <hi>Numa,</hi> that terrible Pe<U+017F>tilence, which was <U+017F>pread over all <hi>Italy,</hi> did likewi<U+017F>e mi<U+017F>erably infe<U+017F>t the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> at which the Citizens being greatly affrighted, and de<U+017F>pairing of health, were again comforted by the report of a brazen Target, which (they <U+017F>ay) fell from Heaven into the hands of <hi>Numa,</hi> and of which they relate <U+017F>trange effects, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the virtue of this miraculous Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47090:202"/>
and that <hi>Numa</hi> having had conference with the Nymph <hi>Egeria,</hi> and <U+017F>ome of the Mu<U+017F>es, he was a<U+017F><U+017F>ured, that that Target was <U+017F>ent from Heaven for the cure and <U+017F>afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the City; and that, becau<U+017F>e on the con<U+017F>ervation thereof the common health and benefit depended, he was ordered by them to make eleven others, <U+017F>o like in all dimen<U+017F>ions and form to the original; that in ca<U+017F>e there <U+017F>hould be a de<U+017F>ign to <U+017F>teal it away, the true might not be di<U+017F>tingui<U+017F>hed or known from tho<U+017F>e which were counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited; by which means there would be more difficulty to defeat the coun<U+017F>els of Fate, or invert the order of divine Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tination: He farther declared, that he was commanded to con<U+017F>ecrate that place and the Fields about it to the Mu<U+017F>es, where he had often entertained a free intercour<U+017F>e and communication with them; and that the Fountain which watered that Field <U+017F>hould be made <U+017F>acred and hallowed for the u<U+017F>e of the Ve<U+017F>tal Virgins, who were to wa<U+017F>h and clean<U+017F>e the penetralia of their Sanctuary with tho<U+017F>e Holy Waters.

            <p>He is al<U+017F>o much to be commended for the repeal, or rather amendment of that Law, which gives power to Fathers to <U+017F>ell their Children; for he exempted <U+017F>uch as were married from that <U+017F>ubjection, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally that they had matched them<U+017F>elves with the liking and con<U+017F>ent of their Parents: for it <U+017F>eemed a very hard and unju<U+017F>t thing, that a woman, who had given her <U+017F>elf in marriage to a man whom <U+017F>he judged free, <U+017F>hould afterwards find her <U+017F>elf betrayed and ca<U+017F>t away upon a Husband that was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47090:208"/>
ob<U+017F>erving, that there was eleven Days dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Lunary and the Solary Year: for that the Moon compleated her Anniver<U+017F>ary cour<U+017F>e in 354 Days, and the Sun in 365; to remedy which inequality, he doubled the eleven Days, and after every two Year added an inter<U+017F>titial to follow the Month of <hi>February,</hi> which the Romans cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Month of <hi>Mercidinus;</hi> but this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count hath <U+017F>ince that time received a better amendment. He al<U+017F>o altered the order of the Months; for <hi>March,</hi> which was recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the fir<U+017F>t, he put into the third place; and <hi>January,</hi> which was the eleventh, he made the fir<U+017F>t; and <hi>February,</hi> which was the twelfth and la<U+017F>t, to be the <U+017F>econd. Some will have it, that it was <hi>Numa</hi> al<U+017F>o which added the two Months of <hi>January</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary:</hi> for in the beginning, when men <note place="margin">Various, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>urd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of the year.</note> were ignorant and barbarous, they compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ed a Year of ten Months: the Arcadians in <hi>Greece</hi> had onely four, in <hi>Arcanania</hi> they accounted by <U+017F>ix; and the Egyptians had at fir<U+017F>t but one Month, which afterwards they divided into four, according to the <U+017F>ea<U+017F>ons of the Year: which Country of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> though it <U+017F>eem new to us, is yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by an ancient people; for if we may believe their Chronicles (unle<U+017F>s they account Months for Years) their Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies are deduced from great Antiquity.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47090:209"/>
And that the Romans at fir<U+017F>t comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the whole Year within ten, and not twelve Months, plainly appears by the name of <hi>December,</hi> which <U+017F>ignifies the tenth Month, and is the la<U+017F>t in order: and that <hi>March</hi> was the fir<U+017F>t is likewi<U+017F>e evident, for that the fifth Month after it was called <hi>Quintilis,</hi> and the <U+017F>ixth <hi>Sextilis,</hi> and <U+017F>o the re<U+017F>t; <U+017F>o that if <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February</hi> had in this account preceded <hi>March, Quintilis</hi> had been put in the <U+017F>eventh place, and <U+017F>o called <hi>September.</hi> It is al<U+017F>o very probable, that this fir<U+017F>t Month was dedicated by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> to <hi>Mars;</hi> the <U+017F>econd to <hi>Venus,</hi> called <hi>April,</hi> from the Greek word <hi>Aphrodites;</hi> which the Women <U+017F>olemnize in honour of that Godde<U+017F>s, adorning their heads on the Kalends, or fir<U+017F>t days of it, with Myrtle Garlands. But others will not allow of the derivation of this word from <hi>Aphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> but rather deduce it from the word <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio,</hi> which in Latin <U+017F>ignifies, to open, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<U+017F>e that this Month is in the high Spring, when all Buds and Flowers open and di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clo<U+017F>e them<U+017F>elves: the next is called <hi>May,</hi> from <hi>Maia</hi> the Mother of <hi>Mercury,</hi> to whom this Month was made <U+017F>acred: then <hi>June</hi> follows, <U+017F>o called from <hi>Juventus,</hi> or youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne<U+017F>s of the Year, which is then warm, and gay, and in its juvenile <U+017F>ea<U+017F>on. To the other Months al<U+017F>o they gave denominations
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47090:209"/>
according to their order, <U+017F>o the fifth was called <hi>Quintilis, Sextilis</hi> the <U+017F>ixth, and <U+017F>o the re<U+017F>t <hi>September, October, November</hi> and <hi>December:</hi> Afterwards <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> when he had overcome <hi>Pompey,</hi> changed the name of the Month <hi>Quintilis</hi> to that of <hi>Julius,</hi> which we call <hi>July;</hi> as al<U+017F>o that of <hi>Sextilis</hi> was changed into <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> which was a <U+017F>irname to the Succe<U+017F><U+017F>our of <hi>Cae<U+017F>ar. Domitian</hi> al<U+017F>o in imitation hereof gave the two other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Months the names of <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>Domitianus,</hi> but, he being <U+017F>lain, they recovered their ancient denominations of <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October;</hi> but the two la<U+017F>t have ever re<U+017F>erved their names without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alteration. The Months which were added, and tran<U+017F>po<U+017F>ed in their order by <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> was <hi>February,</hi> which deduces its name from <hi>Februo,</hi> <U+017F>ignifying a purification by Sacrifice; for then they offered Plants, and celebrated the Fea<U+017F>t of <hi>Lupercalia,</hi> in which many Ceremonies agree with the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities u<U+017F>ed at the Lu<U+017F>trations or clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ing days: but <hi>January</hi> was <U+017F>o called from <hi>Janus,</hi> and a precedency of order given to it by <hi>Numa</hi> before <hi>March,</hi> which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the God <hi>Mars;</hi> intimating in my opinion thereby, that the Arts and civil <U+017F>tudies of Peace are to be preferred before warlike or martial employments. For this <hi>Janus,</hi> whether he were a Daemon, or Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47090:210"/>
or a King, was certainly a great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititian and lover of Arts and Sciences, whereby he transformed the incult natures of men into a gentle and civil di<U+017F>po<U+017F>ition; for which rea<U+017F>on they figure him with two Faces, beholding at the <U+017F>ame time both <U+017F>tates and con<U+017F>titutions of humane kind. His Temple at <hi>Rome</hi> hath two Gates, which they call the Gates of <hi>Mars;</hi> becau<U+017F>e they <U+017F>tand open in the time of War, and <U+017F>hut in the times of Peace, of which latter there was very <U+017F>eldom an example; for when the Roman Empire was enlarged and extended to its utmo<U+017F>t bounds, it was <U+017F>o encompa<U+017F><U+017F>ed with barbarous Nations and Enemies, that it was <U+017F>eldom or never at peace: onely in the time of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus Cae<U+017F>ar,</hi> after he had overcome <hi>Anthony,</hi> that Temple was <U+017F>hut; as likewi<U+017F>e not many years before, when <hi>Marcus Atilius</hi> and <hi>Titus Manlius</hi> were Con<U+017F>uls; but then it continued not <U+017F>o long, before that Wars breaking out, the Gates of <hi>Janus</hi> were again opened: but during <note place="margin">

had much <U+017F>poiled their Country, and through all the Tu<U+017F>can War given them <U+017F>ore diver<U+017F>ions, but were now reduced by <hi>Camillus,</hi> and with great lo<U+017F><U+017F>es <U+017F>hut up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Walls.</p>
            <p>And now in the very heat of the War an <note place="margin">The <U+017F>trange accident of the Alban Lake.</note> accident happened to the Alban Lake no le<U+017F>s wonderfull than the mo<U+017F>t incredible things that are reported, and by rea<U+017F>on no vi<U+017F>ible cau<U+017F>e could be a<U+017F><U+017F>igned, or any natural be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning whereto to a<U+017F>cribe it, it became matter of great amazement. It was the beginning of Autumn, and the Summer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had neither been very rainy, nor in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance over troubled with Southern winds, and of the many Lakes, Brooks and Springs of all <U+017F>orts wherein <hi>Italy</hi> abounds, <U+017F>ome were wholly dried up, others drew very little Water with them. But all the Rivers, as they con<U+017F>tantly u<U+017F>ed in Summer, ran in a very low and hollow Chanel. But the Alban Lake that is fed by no other waters but its own, being compa<U+017F><U+017F>ed about with fruitfull Mountains, without any cau<U+017F>e, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<U+017F>s it were Divine, began vi<U+017F>ibly to ri<U+017F>e and <U+017F>well, increa<U+017F>ing to the feet of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and by degrees reaching to the very tops of them, and all this without any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to<U+017F><U+017F>ing, or agitation of its Waves. At fir<U+017F>t it was the wonder of Shepherds and Herdmen, but when the Earth which like
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:47090:301"/>
a great Dam held up the Lake from falling into the lower grounds, through the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and weight of Water was broken down; and that in a violent <U+017F>tream it ran through the plow'd Fields and Plantations, to di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it <U+017F>elf in the Sea; it did not onely <U+017F>trike terrour in the Romans, but was thought by all the inhabitants of <hi>Italy</hi> to portend <U+017F>ome extraordinary events. But the greate<U+017F>t talk of it was in the Camp that be<U+017F>ieged <hi>Veii,</hi> when once this accident of the Lake came to be known among them, and as in long Sieges it is u<U+017F>ual for parties of both <U+017F>ides to meet and conver<U+017F>e with one another; it happened that a Roman had <note place="margin">A <U+017F>ubtile fetch of a Roman Souldier.</note> gained much confidence and familiarity with one of the be<U+017F>ieged, a man well ver<U+017F>ed in ancient learning, and had the reputation of more than ordinary skill in divination. The Roman ob<U+017F>erving him to be overjoy'd at the <U+017F>tory of the Lake, and to mock at the Siege, told him that this was not the onely prodigy that of late had happened to the Romans, but that others more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than this had befallen them, which he was willing to communicate to him, that he might the better provide for his private affairs in the<U+017F>e publick di<U+017F>tempers. The man greedily embraced the motion, expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to hear <U+017F>ome wonderfull <U+017F>ecrets, but when by little and little he had drill'd him
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:47090:301"/>
on in di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>e, and in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly drawn him a good way from the Gates of the City, he <U+017F>natched him up by the middle, being <U+017F>tronger than he, and by the a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tence of others that came running from the Camp, <U+017F>eized and delivered him to the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The man reduced to this nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, and knowing that de<U+017F>tiny is not to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, di<U+017F>cover'd to them the <U+017F>ecret coun<U+017F>els of his Country. That it was not po<U+017F><U+017F>ible the City <U+017F>hould be taken, untill the Alban Lake, which now broke forth and had found out new pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, was drawn back from that cour<U+017F>e, and <U+017F>o diverted, that it could not mingle with the Sea.

As for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban Water, the Oracle commanded, that if it was po<U+017F><U+017F>ible, they <U+017F>hould draw it from the Sea, and <U+017F>hut it up in its ancient bounds; but if that was not to be done, then they <U+017F>hould bring it down into Ditches and Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches into the lower grounds, and <U+017F>o dry it

up; which me<U+017F><U+017F>age being delivered, the Prie<U+017F>ts performed what related to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and the People went to work, and turned the Water.</p>
            <p>And now the Senate in the tenth year of the War taking away all other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands created <hi>Camillus Dictatour,</hi> who cho<U+017F>e <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> for his General of Hor<U+017F>e; and in the fir<U+017F>t place he made Vows unto the Gods, that if they would grant a happy conclu<U+017F>ion of that War, he would celebrate to their Honour the <hi>great Sports,</hi> and dedicate a Temple to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<U+017F>s whom the Romans call <hi>Matuta the Mother,</hi> but from the Ceremonies which are u<U+017F>ed, one would verily think <U+017F>he was <hi>Leucothea,</hi> for leading a Servant-maid into the <U+017F>ecret part of the Temple they there buffet her, and then drive her out again; and they embrace their Brothers Children, more than their own; and in the matter of Sacrifices u<U+017F>e the <U+017F>ame ceremonies as to <hi>Bacchus</hi> his Nur<U+017F>es, and what is cu<U+017F>tomary in the <U+017F>ad ca<U+017F>e of <hi>Ino</hi> in remembrance of the Concubine. <hi>Camillus</hi> having made the<U+017F>e Vows, marched into the Country of the <hi>Fali<U+017F>ces,</hi> and in a great Battel overthrew them and the <hi>Capenates</hi> their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; afterwards he turned to the Siege of <hi>Veii,</hi> and finding that to take it by a<U+017F><U+017F>ault <note place="margin">

<pb n="435" facs="tcp:47090:302"/>
he cut Mines under ground, the Earth about the City being ea<U+017F>y to break up, and allowing as much depth as would carry on the Works without being di<U+017F>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Enemy. This de<U+017F>ign going on in a hopefull way, he without, gave a<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>aults to the Enemy to divert them about the Walls, whil<U+017F>t they that worked under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground in the Mines were in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being perceived, got within the Ca<U+017F>tle, under the Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi> which was the greate<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t celebrated in all the City. It is reported that the Prince of the Tu<U+017F>cans was at that very time at his Devotions, and that the Prie<U+017F>t after he had looked into the Entrails of the Bea<U+017F>t, <U+017F>hould cry out with a loud voice, That the Gods would give the victory to tho<U+017F>e that <U+017F>hould fini<U+017F>h tho<U+017F>e Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: and that the Romans who were in the mines hearing the words, immediately pull'd down the Floor, and a<U+017F>cending with noi<U+017F>e and cla<U+017F>hing of Weapons, frighted away the Enemy, and <U+017F>natching up the Entrails carried them to <hi>Camillus.</hi> But this may look like a Fable. The City being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <U+017F>torm, and the Souldiers bu<U+017F>ied in pillaging and gathering an infinite quantity of Riches and Spoil, <hi>Camillus</hi> from the high Tower viewing what was done, at fir<U+017F>t wept for pity; and when they that were by, congratulated his good <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:47090:303"/>
he lift up his hands to Heaven, and broke out into this Prayer. <hi>O mo<U+017F>t mighty Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ye Gods that are Judges of good and evil actions, Ye know that not without ju<U+017F>t cau<U+017F>e, but con<U+017F>trained by nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity we have been forced to revenge our <U+017F>elves on the City of our unrighteous and implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But if in the vici<U+017F><U+017F>itude of things, there be any calamity due, to countervail this great felicity, I beg that it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from the City and Army of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and with as little hurt as may be, fall upon my own Head.</hi> Having <U+017F>aid the<U+017F>e words, and ju<U+017F>t turning about (as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tom of the Romans is to turn to the right when they wor<U+017F>hip or pray) he fell flat to the ground, to the a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment of all that were pre<U+017F>ent. But recovering him<U+017F>elf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ently from the fall, he told them, that it had <U+017F>ucceeded to his wi<U+017F>h, a <U+017F>mall mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance in recompence of the greate<U+017F>t good fortune.</p>
            <p>Having <U+017F>acked the City, he re<U+017F>olved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had vowed to carry <hi>Juno</hi>'s Image unto <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Workmen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready for that purpo<U+017F>e, he <U+017F>acrificed to the Godde<U+017F>s, and made his <U+017F>upplications, that <U+017F>he would be plea<U+017F>ed to accept of their devotion toward her, and graciou<U+017F>ly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>afe to accept of a place among the Gods that precided at <hi>Rome:</hi> They <U+017F>ay, that the

               </note> of the action to have won a City that was competitour with <hi>Rome,</hi> and had held out a ten years <U+017F>iege, or exalted with the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of tho<U+017F>e that were about him, a<U+017F><U+017F>umed to him<U+017F>elf more than became a civil and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Magi<U+017F>trate. Among other things was the pride and haughtine<U+017F>s of his Triumph, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving through <hi>Rome</hi> in a Charriot drawn with four White Hor<U+017F>es, no General either before or <U+017F>ince having done the like; for the Romans e<U+017F>teem that carriage to be <U+017F>acred and peculiar onely to the King and Father of the Gods. This alienated the hearts of the Citizens from him who were not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tomed to <U+017F>uch pomp and bravery.</p>
            <p>The <U+017F>econd pique they had again<U+017F>t him, was his oppo<U+017F>ing the Law by which the City was to be divided; for the Tribunes of the People preferred a Law, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Senate <U+017F>hould be divided into two parts, one of which <U+017F>hould remain at home, the other as the lot <U+017F>hould give it remove to the new-taken City. By which means they <U+017F>hould not onely have much more Room, but by the advantage of two great and fair Cities be better able to maintain their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, and the re<U+017F>t of their plentifull For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. The People therefore who were now grown rich and numerous, greedily embraced it, and in great crouds, began
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:47090:304"/>
to tumult in the publick Courts, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to have it put to the Vote. But the Senate and able<U+017F>t Citizens judging the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Tribunes to tend rather to the de<U+017F>truction than divi<U+017F>ion of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet unable to bear up again<U+017F>t it them<U+017F>elves, flew to <hi>Camillus</hi> for a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>tence, who fearing to come to the open encounter, yet by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual flinging in new occa<U+017F>ions to bu<U+017F>y and employ their heads, made a <U+017F>hift to <U+017F>tave off the Law.

For it <U+017F>eems, as he went to the <U+017F>iege of <hi>Veii,</hi> he had vowed to <hi>Apollo,</hi> that if he took the City, he would dedicate to him the tenth of the Spoil.

Some time afterwards, when his Authority was laid down, he brought the matter before the Senate, and the Prie<U+017F>ts at the <U+017F>ame time reported out of the Sacrifices, that the anger of the Gods was portended, and that they were not to be appea<U+017F>ed without expiation and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.

The Senate decreed the obligation to be in force.</p>
            <p>But <U+017F>eeing it was difficult for every one to produce the <U+017F>ame very things they had taken to be divided anew, they ordained that every one upon oath <U+017F>hould bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Publick the tenth part of his gains. This <U+017F>eemed very <U+017F>evere and grievous to the Souldiers, who cea<U+017F>ed not to murmur, that poor men, and <U+017F>uch as had endured <U+017F>o much labour and travail in the War, <U+017F>hould be forced, out of what they had gained and <U+017F>pent, to bring in <U+017F>o great a proportion; <hi>Camillus</hi> being a<U+017F><U+017F>aulted by their clamour and tumults, for want of a better excu<U+017F>e, betook him<U+017F>elf to the meane<U+017F>t of defences, by confe<U+017F><U+017F>ing he had forgotten his Vow; but they complained that he that then vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tenth of the Enemy, now levied it out of the tenths of the Citizens.

The Senate, to give them the honour they had de<U+017F>erved, ordained that funeral Orations <U+017F>hould be u<U+017F>ed at the ob<U+017F>equies of Women, as well as Men, it having never before been a cu<U+017F>tom that any Woman after death was publickly prai<U+017F>ed.

At the fir<U+017F>t he was not perceived through the <U+017F>harpne<U+017F>s of the encounter, and the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of his Armour that hindred the <U+017F>ight of him; but when he had overthrown the Gaul, and was going to gather the Spoils, <hi>Brennus</hi> knew him, and invoking the Gods <note place="margin">Brennus <hi>by what incens'd to make War with</hi> Rome.</note> to be witne<U+017F><U+017F>es, that contrary to the known and common Law of Nations, which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily ob<U+017F>erved by all mankind, that he who came an Amba<U+017F><U+017F>adour <U+017F>hould act ho<U+017F>tility again<U+017F>t him, he drew off his men, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Clu<U+017F>ians farewell, led his Army directly to <hi>Rome.</hi> But not willing it <U+017F>hould look as if they took advantage of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and were ready to embrace any <U+017F>light occa<U+017F>ion and pretence of quarrel, he <U+017F>ent a Herald to demand the man in puni<U+017F>hment, and in the mean time marched lea<U+017F>urely on.

Thus whil<U+017F>t the Barbarians

were ha<U+017F>tening with all <U+017F>peed, the <hi>Military Tribunes</hi> brought the Romans into the Field to be ready to engage them, being not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Gauls in number (for they were no le<U+017F>s than forty thou<U+017F>and Foot) but mo<U+017F>t of them raw Souldiers and <U+017F>uch as had never handled a Weapon before; be<U+017F>ides <note place="margin">Neglect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and multiplicity of Officers extremely prejudicial to the Roman affairs.</note> they had neglected to con<U+017F>ult the Gods, as they ought and u<U+017F>ed to do upon all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, e<U+017F>pecially War, but ran on without <U+017F>taying for Prie<U+017F>t or Sacrifice.

Add to all that the remembrance of <hi>Camillus</hi> his ca<U+017F>e was no <U+017F>mall hinderance to their affairs, it being grown a dangerous thing to command with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out humouring and courting the Souldiers. In this condition they left the City, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped by the River <hi>Allia</hi> about eleven miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> and not far from the place where it falleth into the <hi>Tyber,</hi> where the Gauls coming upon them, and they <U+017F>hame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully engaging without Order or Di<U+017F>cipline, were mi<U+017F>erably defeated. The left Wing was immediately driven into the River and

there utterly de<U+017F>troyed: the Right had le<U+017F>s damage, by declining the <U+017F>hock, and from the low grounds getting to the tops of Hills, from whence many of them afterwards drop'd into the City; the re<U+017F>t as many as e<U+017F>caped (the Enemy being weary of the <U+017F>laughter) <U+017F>tole by night to <hi>Veii</hi> giving <hi>Rome</hi> for gone, and all that was in it for lo<U+017F>t. This Battel was fought about the Summer Sol<U+017F>tice, the Moon being at full, the very <U+017F>ame day in which formerly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that <U+017F>ad misfortune to the <hi>Fabii,</hi> when three hundred of that name and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were at one time cut off by the Tu<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. But from this <U+017F>econd lo<U+017F>s and defeat, the day got the name of <hi>Allien<U+017F>is,</hi> from the River <hi>Allia,</hi> and <U+017F>till retaineth it.

for leaving the City, to make their e<U+017F>cape, and to tho<U+017F>e that remained to provide and prepare for their coming. For they who re<U+017F>olved to <U+017F>tay at <hi>Rome,</hi> quitting the re<U+017F>t of the City, betook them<U+017F>elves to the <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol,</hi> which they fortified with <U+017F>trong Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers and Mounds, and all <U+017F>ort of Slings and Darts, in order to hold out a Siege. But their fir<U+017F>t and principal care was of their Holy Things, mo<U+017F>t of which they convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Capitol.

and was no other than what the Greeks call <hi>Purifying Fire,</hi> but that there were other things hid in the mo<U+017F>t <U+017F>ecret part of the Temple, which were kept from the view of all except tho<U+017F>e Virgins which they call Ve<U+017F>tals. The mo<U+017F>t common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was that the Image of <hi>Pallas,</hi> brought into <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Aeneas,</hi> was laid up there; others <U+017F>ay that the <hi>Samothracian Gods</hi> lay there, telling a <U+017F>tory, How that <hi>Dardanus</hi> carried them to <hi>Troy,</hi> and when he had built that City, dedicated them there; that after <hi>Troy</hi> was taken, <hi>Aeneas</hi> <U+017F>tole them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and kept them till his coming into <hi>Italy.</hi> But they who pretend to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tand more of the<U+017F>e things, affirm, that there are two Barrels, not of any great <U+017F>ize, one of which <U+017F>tands open and has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, the other full and <U+017F>ealed up.

This extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of <hi>Albinus,</hi> and re<U+017F>pect to the Gods in <U+017F>uch an exigence of time, and extremity of his own affairs is <U+017F>o remarkable, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erves not to be pa<U+017F><U+017F>ed over in <U+017F>ilence.

And now the Siege of the Capitol ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving la<U+017F>ted a good while, the Gauls began to be in want of Provi<U+017F>ion, wherefore dividing their Forces, part of them <U+017F>tay'd with the King at the Siege, the re<U+017F>t went to forage the Country, de<U+017F>troying the Towns and Villages where they came; but not all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Body, but in different Squadrons and Parties, and to <U+017F>uch a confidence had <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s rai<U+017F>ed them, that they carele<U+017F>ly ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about without the lea<U+017F>t fear or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen<U+017F>ion of danger.

as much as every man had for his daily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, which was half a pound of Bread, and about half a pint of Wine. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, the affairs of the Gauls were daily in a wor<U+017F>e and wor<U+017F>e condition; they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provi<U+017F>ions, being kept in from forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging through fear of <hi>Camillus;</hi> be<U+017F>ides, that <U+017F>ickne<U+017F>s came upon them, occa<U+017F>ioned by the number of Carca<U+017F><U+017F>es that lay unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in heaps. Moreover, being lodged <note place="margin">A contagious infection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gauls.</note> among the Ruines, the A<U+017F>hes, which were very deep, blown about with the wind, and mingled with the <U+017F>oultry heat, cau<U+017F>ed a dry and pe<U+017F>tilent Air, which drawn in, infected their Bodies. But the chief cau<U+017F>e was the change of their natural Climate, coming out of <U+017F>hady and hilly Countrys, which afforded plea<U+017F>ant retirements and <U+017F>helter from the heat, to lodge in low and champion Grounds, naturally unhealthfull in the Autumn Sea<U+017F>on. Another thing which broke their Spirits, was the length and tediou<U+017F>ne<U+017F>s of the Siege (for they had now <U+017F>ate <U+017F>even months before the Capitol) in<U+017F>omuch, that there was va<U+017F>t de<U+017F>olation among them; and the number of the dead grown <U+017F>o great, that the living <U+017F>carce <U+017F>uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to bury them.

            <p>HAving related the memorable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Pericles,</hi> let us now proceed to the Life of <hi>Fabius.</hi> It is <U+017F>aid, that the fir<U+017F>t of the name was a Son of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> and of a Nymph, or <U+017F>ome Woman of that Country, who brought him forth on the banks of <hi>Tyber,</hi> and that he was a Per<U+017F>on famous and powerfull in <hi>Rome:</hi> Others will have it, that they were fir<U+017F>t called <hi>Fodians,</hi> becau<U+017F>e the Race of them

delighted in digging pit-falls for wild Bea<U+017F>ts, and that in proce<U+017F>s of time, and by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of language, they grew to be called <hi>Fabians.</hi> But the<U+017F>e things be they true or fal<U+017F>e, certain it is, that this Family hath for a long time yielded great <U+017F>tore of eminent Per<U+017F>ons; Our <hi>Fabius,</hi> who was fourth in de<U+017F>cent from that <hi>Fabius Rutilianus,</hi> who fir<U+017F>t brought the honourable <U+017F>irname of <hi>Maximus</hi> into his Family, was al<U+017F>o by way of nick-name called <hi>Verruco<U+017F>us</hi> from a Wart on his upper Lip, and in his Childhood they in like manner named him <hi>Ovicula,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on of his extreme mildne<U+017F>s of Nature. His <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s in <U+017F>peaking, his long labour and pains in learning, his little concern in the <U+017F>ports and diverti<U+017F>ements of his equals, his ea<U+017F>ie <U+017F>ubmi<U+017F><U+017F>ion to every body, as if he had no will of his own, made tho<U+017F>e who judged <U+017F>uperficially of him (the number of which <U+017F>ort of Judges is always the greate<U+017F>t) e<U+017F>teem him in<U+017F>en<U+017F>ible and <U+017F>tupid; And few were they, who could penetrate into the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of his Courage, and greatne<U+017F>s of his Mind. But as <U+017F>oon as he came into Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, his Vertues exerted and <U+017F>hewed them<U+017F>elves; his reputed Dulne<U+017F>s did then appear to be the <U+017F>teddine<U+017F>s, and intrepid bravery of his Soul; his <U+017F>lowne<U+017F>s in words, and actions, to be the effect of a con<U+017F>umma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prudence, which always laid them by,
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:47090:388"/>
till they were thoroughly ripe; and his ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ie compliance to the bent of others, to be a noble pride of his heart, thinking it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath him to contend about trifles.</p>

               </note> of <hi>Rome</hi> proceeded from Military Vertue, and was by the <U+017F>ame means to be pre<U+017F>erved, did therefore inure his Body to labour and exerci<U+017F>e, wi<U+017F>ely judging, that natural <U+017F>trength was the be<U+017F>t Armour: He al<U+017F>o trained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf in the Art of Speaking and Per<U+017F>wading; For words and di<U+017F>cour<U+017F>es are the Engines, by which Minds are moved; And he attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <U+017F>uch a kind of Eloquence, that his manner of <U+017F>peaking, and of acting was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the <U+017F>ame; for although it had not much of Ornament, nor Artifice, yet there was in it great weight of Sen<U+017F>e; it was <U+017F>trong and <U+017F>ententious; much after the way of <hi>Thucydides.</hi> We have yet extant his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Oration upon the death of his Son, who died Con<U+017F>ul, which he recited before the People.</p>
            <p>He was five times Con<U+017F>ul, and in his fir<U+017F>t Con<U+017F>ul<U+017F>hip he had the honour of a Triumph for the Victory he gained upon the Liguri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whom he defeated in a <U+017F>et Battel, and drove them to take <U+017F>helter in the <hi>Alpes,</hi> from whence they never after made any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road, nor depredation upon their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. After this <hi>Hannibal</hi> came into <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <pb n="604" facs="tcp:47090:389"/>
who at his fir<U+017F>t entrance having gained a great Battel near the River <hi>Trebia,</hi> travers'd <note place="margin">Hannibal<hi>'s fir<U+017F>t prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous march into</hi> Italy.</note> all Tu<U+017F>cany with his victorious Army, and de<U+017F>olating the Country round about, fill'd <hi>Rome</hi> it <U+017F>elf with a<U+017F>toni<U+017F>hment and terrour. Be<U+017F>ides unu<U+017F>ual Thunder and Lightning then happening, the report of <U+017F>everal ill-boding Portents did much increa<U+017F>e this popular con<U+017F>ternation. For it was <U+017F>aid, that <U+017F>ome Targets did <U+017F>weat Bloud; that at <hi>Antium,</hi> when they reap'd their Corn, many of the Ears were fill'd with Bloud; that it had rained Fire; that the Phalerians had <U+017F>een the Heavens open and <U+017F>everal Scrolls in form of Lots falling down, in one of which it was plainly writ, <hi>Now</hi> Mars <hi>him<U+017F>elf does brandi<U+017F>h his Arms.</hi> But the<U+017F>e Prodigies had no effect upon the impetuous and fiery temper of the Con<U+017F>ul <hi>Flaminius,</hi> who<U+017F>e na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural promptne<U+017F>s had been much heightned by his late Victory over the Gauls, though he fought them contrary to the order of the Senate and the advice of his Collegue: <U+017F>o that nothing would <U+017F>atisfie him but a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel with <hi>Hannibal. Fabius</hi> on the other <U+017F>ide thought it not <U+017F>ea<U+017F>onable to engage with the Enemy; not that he much regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded tho<U+017F>e talk'd of Prodigies, which he took to be either fictitious or ca<U+017F>ual; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Carthaginian Army was in a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ting condition, without a po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:47090:389"/>
without Magazines, the Souldier un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid; <U+017F>o that their onely hope and <U+017F>afety was in a Battel: But if let alone, watch'd and ob<U+017F>erved, the neighbouring Garri<U+017F>ons in the mean time being well <U+017F>ecur'd and the Roman Allies defended, their vigour would <U+017F>oon expire, like a Flame for want of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The<U+017F>e weighty rea<U+017F>ons prevail'd not with <hi>Flaminius,</hi> who prote<U+017F>ted, he would <note place="margin">Fabius<hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to move</hi> Flaminius.</note> never <U+017F>uffer that the Enemy <U+017F>hould advance one <U+017F>tep farther, and that he would not be reduc'd, like <hi>Camillus</hi> in former time, to fight for <hi>Rome</hi> within the Walls of <hi>Rome.</hi> Accordingly he ordered the Tribunes to draw out the Army into the Field; and as he would not be di<U+017F><U+017F>waded by the rea<U+017F>ons of his Collegue from this precipitous re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, <U+017F>o neither was he deterr'd by an ill pre<U+017F>aging accident which befell him at his <U+017F>etting forth; for he no <U+017F>ooner got on Hor<U+017F>eback, but the Bea<U+017F>t fell into <U+017F>o vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a fit of trembling and bounding that he ca<U+017F>t his Rider headlong on the ground. This notwith<U+017F>tanding, away he marcheth up to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who was po<U+017F>ted near the Lake <hi>Tra<U+017F>imena</hi> in Tu<U+017F>cany. And it is to be ob<U+017F>erv'd, that during the ingagement, there hapned <U+017F>o great an Earthquake, that it de<U+017F>troyed <U+017F>everal Towns, altered the cour<U+017F>e of Rivers, tore off the tops of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, yet <U+017F>uch was the eagerne<U+017F>s of the

Combatants, that they were <U+017F>en<U+017F>ible of no other concu<U+017F><U+017F>ion or agitation, but what them<U+017F>elves made.</p>
            <p>In this Battel <hi>Flaminius</hi> fell, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">He dies cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageou<U+017F>ly.</note> many proofs of his <U+017F>trength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and round about him lay all the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<U+017F>t of the Army: In the whole fifteen thou<U+017F>and were killed, and as many made pri<U+017F>oners. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> de<U+017F>irous to be<U+017F>tow Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Honours upon the Body of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> made diligent <U+017F>earch after it, but could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find what became of it. Though the lo<U+017F>s was <U+017F>o con<U+017F>iderable, yet there was no art u<U+017F>ed to di<U+017F><U+017F>emble it at <hi>Rome;</hi> as there had been, upon the former Ingagement near <hi>Trebia;</hi> for then, neither the General who writ, nor the Expre<U+017F>s who told the news, related it otherwi<U+017F>e than as a drawn Battel, with equal lo<U+017F>s on either <U+017F>ide: But now, as <U+017F>oon as <hi>Pomponius</hi> the Pretor had the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, he cau<U+017F>ed the People to a<U+017F><U+017F>emble, and without di<U+017F>gui<U+017F>ing the matter, told them plainly, <hi>We are beaten (O Romans) our Army is defeated, the Con<U+017F>ul</hi> Flaminius <hi>is kill'd; think therefore, what is to be done for your <U+017F>afety.</hi> The <U+017F>ame commotion, which a furious Wind doth cau<U+017F>e in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, did the<U+017F>e words of the Pretor rai<U+017F>e in the minds of <U+017F>o va<U+017F>t a Multitude: But the rage of their grief being a little over, the danger at hand did at la<U+017F>t awaken their

judgments into a re<U+017F>olution to chu<U+017F>e a Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatour, who by the Sovereign authority of his Office, and by his per<U+017F>onal capacity of wi<U+017F>edom and courage might be able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the publick affairs, become almo<U+017F>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>perate, and to <U+017F>it at Helm in <U+017F>o great a Storm.

            <p>The fir<U+017F>t <U+017F>olemn action of his Dictature <note place="margin">His zeal for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties.</note> was to order publick Prayers to be made to the Gods, and to admoni<U+017F>h the People, that their late overthrow did not befall them through want of courage in their Souldiers, but through the neglect of Divine Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the General. He therefore exhorted them not to fear the Enemy, but by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary honour to appea<U+017F>e the Gods. This he did, not to fill their minds with <U+017F>uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>tition, but onely to rai<U+017F>e their courage, and le<U+017F><U+017F>en in them the fear of the Enemy, by making them believe, that Heaven was on their <U+017F>ide. In order hereunto the Siby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Books were con<U+017F>ulted, in which they conceived, the <U+017F>ecrets of de<U+017F>tiny and future events were to be learnt; but whoever look'd into them, was under a tye of <U+017F>ecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy not to reveal what they found. After this he a<U+017F><U+017F>embled the People, and made a Vow before them to offer in Sacrifice the whole product of the next Sea<U+017F>on all <hi>Italy</hi> over, of the Cows, Goats, Swine, Sheep,
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:47090:391"/>
both in the Mountains and the Plains; and the more to <U+017F>olemnize this great Vow, he commanded the preci<U+017F>e <U+017F>um of 333 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>terces, and 333 Pence, and one third of a Peny to be expended upon fe<U+017F>tival Games in honour of the Gods. What his my<U+017F>tery might be in that number is not ea<U+017F>ie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, unle<U+017F>s it were in regard of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the number of three, as being the fir<U+017F>t of odd numbers, the fir<U+017F>t that contains in it <U+017F>elf multiplication, with all the other properties belonging to any what<U+017F>oever Number be<U+017F>ides.</p>
            <p>In this manner <hi>Fabius</hi> having rai<U+017F>ed the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>He prudently manages the War with</hi> Hannibal.</note> hearts of the People, by making them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Gods took their part, and by the <U+017F>ame means having made them <U+017F>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and pliant to his will, he, for his own part, placed his whole confidence in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>elf, believing that the Gods be<U+017F>towed vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and good fortune onely upon the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and the prudent. Thus prepar'd, he <U+017F>et forth to oppo<U+017F>e <hi>Hannibal,</hi> not with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to fight him, but to wait upon him, to <U+017F>traiten his Quarters, to cut off his Provi<U+017F>ions, and by <U+017F>o doing to make his victorious Army molder away, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ume with penury and want. With this de<U+017F>ign he always incamp'd on the highe<U+017F>t grounds, where their Hor<U+017F>e could have no acce<U+017F>s to him. He <U+017F>till kept pace with

them; when they marched he followed them; when they incamped he did the <U+017F>ame, but at <U+017F>uch a di<U+017F>tance as not to be compell'd to an Ingagement, and always keeping upon the Hills, free from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ults of their Hor<U+017F>e; by which means he gave them no re<U+017F>t, but kept them in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Alarm.</p>
            <p>But this his dilatory fencing way gave occa<U+017F>ion both at <hi>Rome,</hi> and even in his own Camp, to <U+017F>u<U+017F>pect his want of Courage; and this opinion prevail'd al<U+017F>o in <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army, who was him<U+017F>elf the onely man who was not deceived, and who clearly <U+017F>aw his own Ruine in his Enemy's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.

this artifice though it had no effect upon the firmne<U+017F>s and con<U+017F>tancy of the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, yet upon the common Souldier, and even upon the General of the Hor<U+017F>e him<U+017F>elf it had too great an operation: For this <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius,</hi> began to have a contempt of the General and his way of proceeding, which he mi<U+017F>con<U+017F>trued to be a timorous cuncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <U+017F>o that in his harangues he humou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Souldiery in their mad fondne<U+017F>s of coming to a Battel, and in their <U+017F>corn and reproaches which they ca<U+017F>t upon <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> calling him the Pedagogue of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal;</hi> <U+017F>ince he did nothing el<U+017F>e but follow him up and down, and look and wait upon him.

And in his vain fit he would <U+017F>ometimes ask the very Friends and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ticks of the General, Whether it were not his meaning by <U+017F>o leading them from Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Mountain, to carry them at la<U+017F>t (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no hopes on Earth) up into Heaven, and hide them in the Clouds from <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>'s Army? When his Friends related the<U+017F>e

as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was entred into this Valley, <hi>Fabius</hi> di<U+017F>patch'd four thou<U+017F>and choice men to <U+017F>ei<U+017F>e the entrance into it, and <U+017F>top him up; and lodged the re<U+017F>t of his Army upon the neighbouring Hills in the mo<U+017F>t advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous places; but at the <U+017F>ame time he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked a commanded Party of his lighte<U+017F>t armed Men to fall upon <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Rere; which they did with <U+017F>uch <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, that they cut off eight hundred of them, and put the whole Army in di<U+017F>order. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> finding the errour and the danger he was fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, immediately caus'd the poor Guides to be hang'd, which <U+017F>atisfy'd his revenge but did not le<U+017F><U+017F>en his danger: For his Enemies were <U+017F>o advantageou<U+017F>ly po<U+017F>ted, that there was no hopes of breaking thorough them, and his Souldiers began to de<U+017F>pair of ever coming out of tho<U+017F>e Straits.</p>
            <p>Thus reduc'd, <hi>Hannibal</hi> had recour<U+017F>e to <note place="margin">His Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>es.</note> this Stratageme; he cau<U+017F>ed two thou<U+017F>and head of Oxen, which he had in his Camp, to have Torches and dry Bavens well fa<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their Horns, and lighting them in the beginning of the night, he ordred the Bea<U+017F>ts to be fair and foftly drove on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages out of the Valley; when this was done, he made his Army with great <U+017F>ilence march after them. The Oxen at fir<U+017F>t kept a <U+017F>low, orderly pace, and with their lighted Heads re<U+017F>embled an Army
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:47090:394"/>
marching by night, frighting onely the Shepherds and Herd<U+017F>men of the Hills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. But when the fire had burnt down the Horns of the Bea<U+017F>ts to the quick, they no longer ob<U+017F>erved their <U+017F>ober pace, but unruly with their pain, they ran di<U+017F>pers'd about, to<U+017F><U+017F>ing their Heads, and <U+017F>cattering the fire round about them. This became a <U+017F>urpri<U+017F>ing <U+017F>pectacle to the Romans, e<U+017F>peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to tho<U+017F>e, who guarded the Pa<U+017F><U+017F>ages, who being at <U+017F>ome di<U+017F>tance from their main Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and <U+017F>eeing the fire on the <U+017F>udden di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<U+017F>ing it <U+017F>elf on every <U+017F>ide, as if the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had de<U+017F>ign'd to <U+017F>urround them, in great fright and amazement, quitted their Po<U+017F>t, and precipitou<U+017F>ly retir'd to their Camp on the Hills.

            <p>And <hi>Hannibal</hi> (maliciou<U+017F>ly) to improve their hatred again<U+017F>t him, marched with his Army clo<U+017F>e to the Lands and Po<U+017F><U+017F>e<U+017F><U+017F>ions of <hi>Fabius,</hi> and then giving order to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to burn and de<U+017F>troy all the Country about, he forbad them upon pein of death to doe the lea<U+017F>t damage in the Territories of the Roman General, and placed Guards for their <U+017F>ecurity. The<U+017F>e matters reported at <hi>Rome,</hi> had that effect with the People, which <hi>Hannibal</hi> de<U+017F>ired.

The Senate on their part was al<U+017F>o offended with him, for the bargain he had made with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Pri<U+017F>oners, of which the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were, that after the exchange made of Man for Man, if any on either <U+017F>ide remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they <U+017F>hould be redeemed at the price of two hundred and fifty Drachms a Head; and upon the whole account there remained two hundred and forty Romans unexchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. They not onely refu<U+017F>ed to allow money for the Rand<U+017F>omes, but al<U+017F>o reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>Fabius</hi> for making a Contract <U+017F>o con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the honour and intere<U+017F>t of the Commonwealth, in redeeming tho<U+017F>e men at <U+017F>o dear a rate, who had cowardly <U+017F>uffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them<U+017F>elves to be taken by the Enemy. <hi>Fabius</hi> heard and endur'd all this with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible patience; but having no money by him, and on the other <U+017F>ide being re<U+017F>olved to keep his word with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he di<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd his Son to <hi>Rome,</hi> to <U+017F>ell Land, and to bring with him the price, <U+017F>ufficient to di<U+017F>charge the Rand<U+017F>omes; which was punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually performed by his Son, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Pri<U+017F>oners were delivered to him; among<U+017F>t whom many that were able, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered when they were relea<U+017F>ed, to repay the money of their Rand<U+017F>ome, but <hi>Fabius</hi> would not permit them to doe it.</p>

About this time <hi>Fabius</hi> was called to <hi>Rome</hi> by the Prie<U+017F>ts, to a<U+017F><U+017F>i<U+017F>t (according to the duty of his Office) at <U+017F>ome of their <U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Sacrifices; whereby he was forced to leave the command of the Army with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius;</hi> but before he parted, he charged him, and intreated him, in his ab<U+017F>ence, not to come to a Battel with <hi>Hannibal:</hi> His commands, his intreaties, and his advice <note place="margin">Minutius <hi>in</hi> Fabius<hi>'s ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ence attacks the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>

When word was brought to <hi>Rome</hi> that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> after the Fight, had marched with his Army into the remoter parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> the hearts of the Romans began to recover again their ancient vigour and re<U+017F>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; they <U+017F>ent forth an Army under the command of <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

For <hi>Marcellus,</hi> as we have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <U+017F>et forth in his Life, was a man of action, bold, vigorous and enterpri<U+017F>ing, and (as <hi>Homer</hi> de<U+017F>cribes his Warriours) <hi>fierce,</hi> and <hi>delighting</hi> in <hi>fights.</hi> So that having to doe with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> a man of his own temper, they never failed upon all occa<U+017F>ions to come to an Ingagement. But <hi>Fabius</hi> adher'd to his former principles, <U+017F>till per<U+017F>waded, that by following clo<U+017F>e and not fighting him, <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his Army would at la<U+017F>t be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out and con<U+017F>umed; like an able Wre<U+017F>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who with too much exerci<U+017F>e and toil grows languid and weak.

With good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on our General did judge, that if tho<U+017F>e who have the government of Hor<U+017F>es and Bea<U+017F>ts, endeavour by gentle u<U+017F>age to make them tractable and fit for <U+017F>ervice, rather than by cruelty and beating; much more

the Brother had notice of the Amour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: whereupon the young Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine took an occa<U+017F>ion to tell his Si<U+017F>ter, how he had heard, that a man of quality and great authority had made his addre<U+017F><U+017F>es to her; Therefore he de<U+017F>ired her to tell him who it was; <hi>for</hi> (<U+017F>aid he) <hi>if he be a man that has bravery and reputation, it matters not what Country-man he is; <U+017F>ince at this time the Sword mingles all Nations and makes them equal; and an alliance with <U+017F>uch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>on, in this Reign of</hi> Mars, <hi>is both honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and profitable.</hi> Hereupon the Woman <U+017F>ends for her Gallant, and makes the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and him great Friends: and whereas <U+017F>he henceforth <U+017F>hew'd more countenance to her Lover than formerly, by the <U+017F>ame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees that her kindne<U+017F>s increa<U+017F>ed did his friend<U+017F>hip al<U+017F>o with the Brother advance.

               <pb n="645" facs="tcp:47090:409"/>
was at this time partly worn away with continual action, and partly become <U+017F>oft and di<U+017F><U+017F>olute with great opulency and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

            <p>To <U+017F>ay the truth, when <hi>Fabius</hi> fir<U+017F>t op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd this project of <hi>Scipio,</hi> I believe he did it in con<U+017F>ideration onely of the publick <U+017F>afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of the danger which the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth might incur by <U+017F>uch a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: but when he found <hi>Scipio</hi> every day increa<U+017F>ing in the e<U+017F>teem of the People, envy then and ambition took hold of him, which made him <U+017F>o violent in his oppo<U+017F>ition.

               </head>
               <p>YOU have here had the Lives of two per<U+017F>ons very illu<U+017F>trious for their Civil and Military Endowments; Let us fir<U+017F>t compare them in their warlike Capacity. <hi>Pericles</hi> pre<U+017F>ided in his Commonwealth, when it was in a mo<U+017F>t flouri<U+017F>hing and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent condition, great in Power and happy in Succe<U+017F>s; <U+017F>o that he <U+017F>eem'd to <U+017F>tand rather <U+017F>upported by, than <U+017F>upporting the Fortune of his Country. But the bu<U+017F>ine<U+017F>s of <hi>Fabius,</hi> who undertook the Government in the wor<U+017F>t and mo<U+017F>t difficult times, was not to con<U+017F>erve and maintain a well e<U+017F>tabli<U+017F>h'd fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of a pro<U+017F>perous State, but to rai<U+017F>e and uphold a <U+017F>inking and ruinous Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Be<U+017F>ides the Victories of <hi>Cimon,</hi> of <hi>Myronides</hi> and <hi>Leocrates,</hi> with tho<U+017F>e many famous exploits of <hi>Tolmides,</hi> were made u<U+017F>e of by <hi>Pericles</hi> onely to entertain the People at home, and to plea<U+017F>e their Fancy with Triumphs, Fea<U+017F>ts and Games of the <hi>Circus</hi>
                  <pb n="653" facs="tcp:47090:413"/>
and Theatre; not to inlarge their Empire by pro<U+017F>ecuting the War: Whereas <hi>Fabius,</hi> when he took upon him the Government, had the frightfull object before his eyes of Roman Armies de<U+017F>troy'd, of their Generals and Con<U+017F>uls <U+017F>lain, of all the Countries round <U+017F>trew'd with the dead Bodies, and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <U+017F>tain'd with the Bloud of his fellow Citizens; and yet with his mature and <U+017F>olid Coun<U+017F>els, with the firmne<U+017F>s of his Re<U+017F>oluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he, as it were, put his Shoulders to the falling Commonwealth, and kept it up from foundring, through the failings and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<U+017F>s of others. Perhaps it may be more ea<U+017F>ie to govern a City broken and tamed with calamities and adver<U+017F>ity, and compell'd to obey by danger and nece<U+017F><U+017F>ity, than to rule a People pamper'd and re<U+017F>ty with long Pro<U+017F>perity, as were the Athenians when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi> held the reins of Government. But then again, not to be daunted nor di<U+017F>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd with the va<U+017F>t heap of Calamities under which the people of <hi>Rome</hi> did at that time grone and <U+017F>uccumb, argues the temper of <hi>Fabius</hi> to be invincible, and his courage more than humane.</p>
               <p>We may <U+017F>et <hi>Tarentum</hi> re-taken, again<U+017F>t <hi>Samos</hi> won by <hi>Pericles,</hi> and the conque<U+017F>t of <hi>Euboea</hi> we may put in balance with the Towns of <hi>Campania;</hi> though <hi>Capua</hi> it <U+017F>elf was afterwards <U+017F>ubdued by the Con<U+017F>uls <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
                  <pb n="654" facs="tcp:47090:414"/>
and <hi>Appius.</hi> I do not find that <hi>Fabius</hi> won any <U+017F>et Battel, but that again<U+017F>t the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurians, for which he had his Triumph; whereas <hi>Pericles</hi> erected nine Trophies for as many Victories obtain'd by Land and by Sea. But no action of <hi>Pericles</hi> can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd <note place="margin">Pericles<hi>'s numerous Victories eclip<U+017F>ed by one of</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius<hi>'s.</hi>
                  </note> to that memorable re<U+017F>cue of <hi>Minutius,</hi> when <hi>Fabius</hi> redeem'd both him and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from utter de<U+017F>truction; an Action, which comprehends the height of Valour, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Humanity. On the other <U+017F>ide, it does not appear, that <hi>Pericles</hi> was ever <U+017F>o over-reach'd as <hi>Fabius</hi> was by <hi>Hannibal</hi> with his flaming Oxen; never was there <U+017F>o cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and <U+017F>o great an advantage lo<U+017F>t over an Enemy: For in the Valley of <hi>Ca<U+017F>ilinum Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> was <U+017F>hut up without any po<U+017F><U+017F>ibility of forcing his way out, and yet by Stratageme in the night he frees him<U+017F>elf out of tho<U+017F>e Straits, and when day came, wor<U+017F>ted the Enemy, who had him before at his mercy.</p>
               <p>It is the part of a good General, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to provide for, and judge well of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ent, but al<U+017F>o to have a clear fore<U+017F>ight of things to come. In this <hi>Pericles</hi> excell'd, for he admoni<U+017F>h'd the Athenians, and told them beforehand, what ruine their la<U+017F>t War would bring upon them, by gra<U+017F>ping more than they were able to manage. But <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> was not <U+017F>o good a Prophet, when he denounced to the Romans, that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:47090:414"/>
of <hi>Scipio</hi> would be the de<U+017F>truction of the Commonwealth. So that <hi>Pericles</hi> was a good Prophet of bad <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s, and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> was a bad Prophet of <U+017F>ucce<U+017F>s that was good. And indeed, to loo<U+017F>e an advantage through diffidence, is no le<U+017F>s blameable in a General than to fall into danger for want of fore<U+017F>ight; For both the<U+017F>e faults, though of a contrary nature, <U+017F>pring from the <U+017F>ame root, which is want of judgment and experience.</p>
               <p>As for their Civil Policy; it is imputed to <hi>Pericles</hi> that he was a lover of War, and that no terms of Peace, offer'd by the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians, would content him. It is true, that <hi>Fabius</hi> al<U+017F>o was not for yielding any thing to the Carthaginians, but would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hazard all than le<U+017F><U+017F>en the Empire of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet this difference there was between them, that <hi>Fabius</hi> made War onely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>erve and recover his own, and <hi>Pericles</hi> to gain what belong'd to others. But then, the mildne<U+017F>s of <hi>Fabius</hi> towards his Collegue <hi>Minutius</hi> does, by way of compari<U+017F>on, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproach and condemn the eager pro<U+017F>ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Pericles,</hi> and his practices to bani<U+017F>h <hi>Cimon</hi> and <hi>Thucydides,</hi> who held with the Nobility, and were true lovers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Indeed the authority of <hi>Pericles</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> was much greater than that of <hi>Fabius</hi> in <hi>Rome;</hi> for which rea<U+017F>on it was more ea<U+017F>ie for him to prevent mi<U+017F>carriages commonly
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:47090:415"/>
ari<U+017F>ing from weakne<U+017F>s and in<U+017F>ufficiency of Officers, <U+017F>ince he had got the <U+017F>ole nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and management of them; onely <hi>Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides</hi> broke loo<U+017F>e from him, and contrary to his orders, unadvi<U+017F>edly fought with the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> and was <U+017F>lain: whereas <hi>Fabius,</hi> for want of that general power and influence upon the Officers, had not the means to obviate their mi<U+017F>carriages; but it had been happy for the Romans if his Authority had been greater; for <U+017F>o we may pre<U+017F>ume, their di<U+017F>a<U+017F>ters had been fewer.</p>
               <p>As to their liberality and publick <U+017F>pirit, <hi>Pericles</hi> was eminent in never taking any gifts, and <hi>Fabius</hi> for giving his own money to ran<U+017F>ome his Souldiers; though the <U+017F>um did not exceed <U+017F>ix Talents. This right we mu<U+017F>t doe <hi>Pericles,</hi> that no man had ever greater opportunities to enrich him<U+017F>elf (as having had pre<U+017F>ents offer'd him from <U+017F>o many Kings and Princes, and States of his Alliance) yet no man was ever more free from corruption. And for the beauty and magnificence of Temples and publick Edifices, with which he adorn'd his Country, it mu<U+017F>t be confe<U+017F>t, that all the Ornaments and Structures of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the time of the <hi>Cae<U+017F>ars,</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to compare, either in greatne<U+017F>s of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>ign or of expence, with the lu<U+017F>tre of tho<U+017F>e which <hi>Pericles</hi> onely erected at <hi>Athens.</hi>
