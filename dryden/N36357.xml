            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>OVID'S <hi>Art of Love,</hi> having lately appeared in <hi>French</hi> with <hi>Ob<U+017F>ervations</hi> written by the tran<U+017F>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which have been very well received in <hi>France;</hi> it has been thought proper to add <U+017F>uch of them as are mo<U+017F>t curious to this <hi>ver<U+017F>ion,</hi> and to make other new <hi>remarks</hi> in <U+017F>ome places, where the <hi>Engli<U+017F>h tran<U+017F>lators</hi> have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven another <hi>turn</hi> to the <hi>original.</hi> The <hi>introduction</hi> to the<U+017F>e <hi>ob<U+017F>ervations</hi> is entirely the <hi>French</hi> author's; <U+017F>o are mo<U+017F>t of the reflections. 'Tis hop'd tho<U+017F>e that are not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, will not be found to be of le<U+017F>s importance than tho<U+017F>e that are<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g>
            </p>
            <p>A great many people are mi<U+017F>taken in the<U+017F>e books: and though they were made u<U+017F>e of as a pretence to drive the author from the court of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> and confine him to <hi>Tomos,</hi> on the frontiers of the <hi>Getae</hi> and <hi>Surmatae,</hi> yet they were not the true cau<U+017F>e of his confinement. They are very far from being <U+017F>o licentious as the writings of <U+017F>everal other poets, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> However, we mu<U+017F>t own he might have been a little more di<U+017F>creet, e<U+017F>pecially in <U+017F>ome places.</p>

In a word, there's nothing in them that comes near the <hi>licence</hi> of <U+017F>ome <hi>epigrams</hi> of <hi>Catullus Martial,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>onius,</hi> of <U+017F>ome <hi><U+017F>atyrs</hi> of <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Juvenal,</hi> and <U+017F>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other pieces of <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>modern</hi> authors which are read and commented upon; and about which even cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated <hi>Je<U+017F>uits</hi> and other religious per<U+017F>ons, as eminent for their piety as their erudition, have employed their <U+017F>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Yet who has condemn'd or complain'd of them? We mu<U+017F>t confe<U+017F>s, <U+017F>uch things <U+017F>hould be manag'd with addre<U+017F>s: and tho<U+017F>e of them who have meddled with any of the authors I have named, have <U+017F>hewn that it may be done <U+017F>o, by their <U+017F>ucceeding <U+017F>o happily in it.</p>
            <p>As for this treati<U+017F>e of the <hi>Art of Love,</hi> for which the author has al<U+017F>o pre<U+017F>crib'd a <hi>remedy,</hi> as it is liable to be all interpreted by tho<U+017F>e who<U+017F>e pens poi<U+017F>on every thing they touch; <U+017F>o it may bear a good con<U+017F>truction, by <U+017F>uch as know how to turn every thing to advantage.</p>
            <p>I will yet <U+017F>ay, this <hi>Art</hi> may be apply'd to tho<U+017F>e that intend to marry. There is nothing <U+017F>ure again<U+017F>t decency in all that. I agree, if you will have it <U+017F>o, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends <U+017F>o far as to direct one to the means to gain a mi<U+017F><g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre<U+017F>s. If this was not lawful heretofore in <hi>Italy,</hi> on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the jealous humour of the <hi>Italians,</hi> we cannot, for the <U+017F>ame rea<U+017F>on only, <U+017F>ay it ought to be forbidden in our country, any more than in <U+017F>everal others, provided we could be <U+017F>ure the ladies mode<U+017F>ty would not be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before whom youth <U+017F>hould be always careful not to exceed the bounds of the re<U+017F>pect that's due to them.</p>
            <p>Be it as it will, I have thought of endeavouring to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all that is <U+017F>aid in tho<U+017F>e books of wanton <hi>love,</hi> to the <hi>art</hi> of loving the <hi><U+017F>ciences.</hi> The <hi>emblem</hi> is not di<U+017F>agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, neither is it impo<U+017F><U+017F>ible to explain all that <hi>Ovid</hi> has written here upon the love of <hi>beauty</hi> by that of the <hi>arts.</hi> What do we not <U+017F>ometimes under<U+017F>tand by the loves of a <U+017F>hepherd and <U+017F>hepherde<U+017F>s? By a lover of incomparable beauty, and his fair one pa<U+017F><U+017F>ionately in love? But, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fable, how often has the loves of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:047526_0006_1023BD69AB0F5C78"/>
               <hi>Juno</hi> been moraliz'd upon, as well as tho<U+017F>e of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Daphne, Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus, Myrrha</hi> and <hi>Cynaras,</hi> and <U+017F>everal others, the examples of which are almo<U+017F>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite? Yet the<U+017F>e things are <U+017F>een every day, all the world read and admire them. Tho' the out<U+017F>ide of them is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <U+017F>trong, and the literal <U+017F>en<U+017F>e more <U+017F>u<U+017F>pected, than any of the precepts laid down in <hi>Ovid's Art of Love</hi> are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious.</p>
            <p>But, to <U+017F>often this thought a little, let us figure to our<U+017F>elves, that the poet is not only a <hi>gallant</hi> of the court of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus,</hi> but a philo<U+017F>opher of the <hi>Portic</hi> and <hi>Lyceum;</hi> who propo<U+017F>es to us, as to his di<U+017F>ciples, excellent rules to acquire the <hi>virtues</hi> and <hi><U+017F>ciences,</hi> repre<U+017F>ented under the name of the <hi>mu<U+017F>es,</hi> or ladies of various beauty, who may be met with every where, e<U+017F>pecially in great academies, in the <U+017F>chools, in courts, in walks, and in holy places; figured by <hi>cirques, theatres, galleries, portices,</hi> and the <hi>temples</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> deities, where great a<U+017F><U+017F>emblies were held. And when we have cho<U+017F>en that which plea<U+017F>es us be<U+017F>t, and is mo<U+017F>t agreeable to our nature; let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to gain its good graces, and enjoy it, that we may become more wi<U+017F>e, and more virtuous. Thus we may deceive our imagination: and 'twill be ea<U+017F>y for us to make the reading of this treati<U+017F>e, not only plea<U+017F>ant, but profitable. We need not then have any <U+017F>cruple upon us, becau<U+017F>e there is nothing uncha<U+017F>te in the expre<U+017F><U+017F>ion, though <U+017F>uch things as are entirely gallant are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected; at lea<U+017F>t no farther than mode<U+017F>ty and decency requir'd. I will, if I can, explain my thoughts in this matter, according as occa<U+017F>ion may offer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of the Art of Love.</hi> By this we ought to under<U+017F>tand how we mu<U+017F>t love, or how we mu<U+017F>t pre<U+017F>erve the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc><<U+25CA>></desc>
               </gap> of our love, when we have once acquir'd it. Otherwi<U+017F>e 'twas u<U+017F>ele<U+017F>s to write an <hi>Art of love.</hi> For <hi>love</hi> is form'd in the heart without <hi>art,</hi> and all are without <hi>art</hi> <U+017F>u<U+017F>cep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of that pa<U+017F><U+017F>ion. It generally <U+017F>urprizes us, and we know not from whence it comes, though we feel it very <U+017F>en<U+017F>ibly. For this rea<U+017F>on the poets <U+017F>o often endeavour to
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:047526_0007_1023BD6CE5BB5128"/>
per<U+017F>uade us that <hi>love</hi> is a potent <hi>god,</hi> who wounds every thing with his darts; and that there is no creature able to re<U+017F>i<U+017F>t him. We therefore need no <hi>art</hi> to teach us to <hi>love,</hi> or even to <hi>love</hi> any thing rea<U+017F>onably; but 'tis of very great importance to each of us, that, when we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/><U+017F>pir'd, the in<U+017F>piration <U+017F>hould be for a proper object, and a good end, as I de<U+017F>ign to <U+017F>hew you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ovid.</hi> This poet wrote the<U+017F>e books a few years before his exile, under colour of which the <hi>decree</hi> of the <U+017F>enate for his bani<U+017F>hment was procur'd<g ref="char:punc"><U+25AA></g> though they certainly were not the <hi>cau<U+017F>e</hi> of it; and indeed could not rea<U+017F>onably be <U+017F>o, unle<U+017F>s <hi>Ovid</hi> wrote them in favour of <hi>Augu<U+017F>tus'</hi>s grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter, whom he vi<U+017F>ited with a little too much fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, and did it to plea<U+017F>e her. For <U+017F>he, no more than her mother, <hi>Agrippa'</hi>s wife, was not <U+017F>o mode<U+017F>t as per<U+017F>ons of quality and high condition ought to be, as well for their own glory, as for an example to others.</p>
            <p>The two fir<U+017F>t books of the <hi>Art of Love,</hi> contain the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which the author lays down for young men to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in their court<U+017F>hip to the ladies, and the third teaches the ladies how they ought to make them<U+017F>elves belov'd. The allegory is not unea<U+017F>ily applied to the <hi><U+017F>ciences</hi> and the <hi>virtues,</hi> repre<U+017F>ented as lovely women, after my way of imagining it.</p>
