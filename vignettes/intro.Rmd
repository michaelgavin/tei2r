# Introduction

The `tei2r` package is designed for humanities scholars and students interested in using R for text analysis. Its creation was prompted by the recent public release of thousands of documents by the Text Creation Partnership, including Early English Books Online, Evans, and Eighteenth-Century Collections Online. `tei2r` has built-in functions that allow users easily to access and download TCP files from Github, \href{https://github.com/textcreationpartnership}{where they are freely available}.

You don't need to be an experienced R programmer to use `tei2r`. Its most important functions require learning only a small handful of commands, which are explained below. `tei2r` makes it easy to measure word frequencies, build concordances, and train topic models. Each of these operations is explained in this introduction (which can be followed step-by-step in less than 20 minutes). For this reason, `tei2r` is ideal for DH-curious scholars with a strong interest in early modern literature and history.

Scholars already comfortable doing text analysis with R or Python may still find `tei2r` useful, because its method for organizing objects in the R environment makes it extremely easy to work with small- to medium-sized collections. Forthcoming complementary packages -- `htn` for historical text network analysis and `empson` for vector-space modeling -- build on and extend the core `tei2r` functionalities with more complex techniques.

Anyone using `tei2r` should feel free to email Michael Gavin at \email{mgavin@@mailbox.sc.edu} with questions, requests, bug reports, suggestions, or offers to help.
