Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserableDoing or suffering: but of this be sure,To do ought good never will be our task,But ever to do ill our sole delight, As being the contrary to his high willWhom we resist. If then his ProvidenceOut of our evil seek to bring forth good,Our labour must be •…o pe•…vert that end,And out of good still to find means of evil;Which oft times may▪ succeed, so as perhapsshall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturbHis i•…st counsels from their destind pursuit.

        Of heaven received us falling, and the Thunder,Winged with red Lightning and impetuous rage,Perhaps hath spent his shasts, and ceases nowTo bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde, The seat of desolation, voyd of light,save what the glimmering of these livid fl•…sCasts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tendFrom off the tossing of these fiery waves,There rest, if any rest can harbour there,And reassembling our asflicted Powers,Consult how we may henceforth most offendOur Enemy, our own loss how repair,How overcome this dire Calamity,What reinforcement we may gain from Hope, If not what resolution from despare. Thus satan talking to his neerest MateWith Head up-lift above the wave, and EyesThat sparkling blazed, his other Parts besidesProne on the Flood, extended long and largeLay floating many a rood, in bulk as hugeAs whom the Fables name of monstrous size,Titanian, or Earth-born, that warred on Jove,
        Briarios or Typhon, whom the DenBy ancient T•…sus held, or that sea-beast Leviathan, which God of all his worksCreated hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:Him haply slumbring on the Norway foamThe Pilot of some small night foundered skiff,Deeming some Island, oft, as sea men tell,With fixed Anchor in his skaly rindMoors by his side under the Lee, while NightInvests the sea, and wished Morn delayes:so stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend layChained on the burning Lake, nor ever thence Had ris'n or heaved his head, but that the willAnd high permission of all-ruling HeavenLeft him at large to his own dark designs,That with reiterated crimes he mightHeap on himself damnation, while he soughtEvil to others, and enraged might seeHow all his malice served but to bring forthInfinite goodness, grace and mercy shewnOn Man by him seduc't, but on himselfTreble confusion, wrath and vengeance poured. Forthwith upright he rears from off the PoolHis mighty stature; on each hand the flamesDrivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowldIn billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale. Then with expanded wings he stears his flightAloft, incumbent on the dusky AirThat felt unusual weight, till on dry LandHe lights, if it were Land that ever burnedWith solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;And such appeared in hue, as when the force Of subterranean wind transports a HillTorn from Pelorus, or the shattered sideOf thundring Aetna, whose combustibleAnd feweled entrals thence conceiving Fire,sublimed with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,And leave a singed bottom all involvedWith stench and smoak: such resting found the soleOf unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate,Both glorying to have scap't the stygian floodAs Gods, and by their own recovered strength, Not by the sufferance of supernal Power. Is this the Region, this the soil, the Clime,said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seatThat we must change for heaven, this mournful gloomFor that celestial light? Be it so, since heeWho now is sovran can dispose and bidWhat shall be right: fardest from him is bestWhom reason hath equald, force hath made supreamAbove his equals. Farewel happy FieldsWhere Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail Infernal world, and thou profoundest HellReceive thy new Possessor: One who bringsA mind not to be changed by Place or Time. The mind is its own place, and in it selfCan make a heaven of Hell, a Hell of heaven. What matter where, if I be still the same,And what I should be, all but less then heeWhom Thunder hath made greater? Here at leastWe shall be free; th' Almighty hath not builtHere for his envy, will not drive us hence: Here we may reign secure, and in my choyceTo reign is worth ambition though in Hell:Better to reign in Hell, then serve in heaven▪
        But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,Th' associates and copartners of our lossLye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,And call them not to share with us their partIn this unhappy Mansion, or once moreWith rallied Arms to try what may be yetRegaind in heaven, or what more lost in Hell? so satan spake, and him Bëëlzebub
        Thus answered. Leader of those Armies bright,Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledgeOf hope in fears and dangers, heard so oftIn worst extreams, and on the perilous edgeOf battel when it raged, in all assaultsTheir surest signal, they will soon resumeNew courage and revive, though now they lyeGroveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire, As we erewhile, astounded and amazed,No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth. He scarce had ceas't when the superiour FiendWas moving toward the shore; his ponderous shieldEthereal temper, massy, large and round,Behind him cast; the broad circumferenceHung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose OrbThrough Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist viewsAt Ev'ning from the top of Fesole,
        Or in Valdarno, to desc•…y new Lands, Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe. His spear, to equal which the tallest PineHewn on Norwegian hills, to be the MastOf some great A•…miral, were but a wand,He walkt with to support uneasie stepsOver the burning Marle, not like those stepsOn Heavens Azure, and the torrid Climesmote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;Nathless he so endured, till on the BeachOf that inflamed sea, he stood and called His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans'tThick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the BrooksIn Vallombrasa, where th' Etrurian shadesHigh overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedgeAfloat, when with fierce Winds Orion armedHath vext the Red-sea Coast, whose waves orethrewBusiris and his Memphian Chivalrie,VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursuedThe sojourners of Goshen, who beheldFrom the safe shore their floating Carkases And broken Chariot VVheels, so thick bestrownAbject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,Under amazement of their hideous change. He called so loud, that all the hollow DeepOf Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates,Warriers, the Flowr of heaven, once yours, now lost,If such astonishment as this can siezeEternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this placeAfter the toyl of Battel to reposeYour wearied vertue, for the ease you find To slumber here, as in the Vales of heaven?Or in this abject posture have ye swornTo adore the Conquerour? who now beholdsCherube and seraph rowling in the FloodWith scattered Arms and Ensigns, till anonHis swift pursuers from heaven Gates discernTh' advantage, and descending tread us downThus drooping, or with linked ThunderboltsTransfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe. Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n. They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprungUpon the wing, as when men wont to watchOn duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. Nor did they not perceave the evil plightIn which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeydInnumerable. As when the potent •…odOf Amrams son in Egypts evill dayWaved round the Coast, up called a pitchy cloud Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind,That ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh hungLike Night, and darkened all the Land of Nile:
        so numberless were those bad Angels seenHovering on wing under the Cope of Hell'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted spearOf their great sultan waving to directThir course, in even ballance down they lightOn the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain; A multitude, like which the populous NorthPoured never from her frozen loyns, to passRhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous sonsCame like a Deluge on the south, and spreadBeneath Gibraltar to the Lybian sands. Forthwith from every squadron and each BandThe Heads and Leaders thither hast where stoodTheir great Commander; Godlike shapes and formsExcelling human, Princely Dignities,And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones; Though of their Names in heavenly Records nowBe no memorial, blotted out and rasedBy thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life. Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve
        Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,By falsities and lyes the greatest partOf Mankind they corrupted to forsakeGod their Creator, and th' invisibleGlory of him, that made them, to transform Oft to the Image of a Brute, adornedWith gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,And Devils to adore for Deities:Then were they known to men by various Names,And various Idols through the Heathen World. say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,Roused from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,At thir great Emperors call, as next in worthCame singly where he stood on the bare strand,While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof? The chief were those who from the Pit of HellRoaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fixTheir seats long after next the seat of God,Their Altars by his Altar, Gods adoredAmong the Nations round, and durst abideJehovah thundring out of sion, thronedBetween the Cherubim; yea, often placedWithin his sanctuary it self their shrines,Abominations; and with cursed thingsHis holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profaned, And with their darkness durst affront his light. First Moloch, horrid King besmeared with bloodOf human sacrifice, and parents tears,Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loudTheir childrens cries unheard, that past through fireTo his grim Idol. Him the Ammonite
        Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain,In Argob and in Basan, to the streamOf utmost Arnon. Nor content with suchAudacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart Of solomon he led by fraud to buildHis Temple right against the Temple of GodOn that opprobrious Hill, and made his GroveThe pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thenceAnd black Gehenna called, the Type of Hell. Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moabs sons,From Aroer to Nebo, and the wildOf southmost Abarim; in Hesebon
        And Heronaim, seons Realm, beyondThe flowry Dale of sibma clad with Vines, And Eleale to th' Asphaltick Pool. Peor his other Name, when he enticedIsrael in sittim on their march from Nile
        To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlargedEven to that Hill of scandal, by the GroveOf Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate;Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell. With these came they, who from the bordring sloodOf old Euphrates to the Brook that parts Egypt from syrian ground, had general NamesOf Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male,These Feminine. For spirits when they pleaseCan either sex assume, or both; so softAnd uncompounded is their Essence pure,Not tied or manacled with joynt or limb,Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they chooseDilated or condens't, bright or obscure,Can execute their aerie purposes, And works of love or enmity fulfill. For those the Race of Israel oft forsookTheir living strength, and unfrequented leftHis righteous Altar, bowing lowly downTo bestial Gods; for which their heads as lowBowed down in Battel, sunk before the spearOf despicable foes. With these in troopCame Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians calledAstarte, Queen of heaven, with crescent Horns;To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon sidonian Virgins paid their Vows and songs,In sion also not unsung, where stoodHer Temple on th' offensive Mountain, builtBy that uxorious King, whose heart though large,Beguiled by fair Idolatresses, fellTo Idols foul. Thammuz came next behind,Whose annual wound in Lebanon alluredThe syrian Damsels to lament his fateIn amorous dittyes all a summers day,While smooth Adonis from his native Rock Ran purple to the sea, supposed with bloodOf Thammuz yearly wounded: the Love-taleInfected sions daughters with like heat,Whose wanton passions in the sacred PorchEzekiel saw, when by the Vision ledHis eye survaied the dark IdolatriesOf alienated Judah. Next came oneWho mourned in earnest, when the Captive ArkMaimed his brute Image, head and hands lopt offIn his own Temple, on the grunsel edge, Where he fell flat, and shamed his Worshipers:Dagon his Name, sea Monster, upward ManAnd downward Fish: yet had his Temple highReared in Azotus, dreaded through the CoastOf Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon,
        And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds. Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seatWas fair Damascus, on the fertil BanksOf Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams. He also against the house of God was bold: A Leper once he lost and gained a King,Ahaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drewGods Altar to disparage and displaceFor one of syrian mode, whereon to burnHis odious offrings, and adore the GodsWhom he had vanquisht. After these appearedA crew who under Names of old Renown,Osiris, Isis, Orus and their TrainWith monstrous shapes and sorceries abusedFanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek Thir wandring Gods disguised in brutish formsRather then human. Nor did Israel scapeTh' infection when their borrowed Gold composedThe Calf in Orcb: and the Rebel KingDoubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,
        Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,Jehovah, who in one Night when he passedFrom Egypt marching, equaled with one strokeBoth her first born and all her bleating Gods. Belial came last, then whom a spirit more lewd Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to loveVice for it self: To him no Temple stoodOr Altar smoaked; yet who more oft then heeIn Temples and at Altars, when the PriestTurns Atheist, as did Ely's sons, who filledWith lust and violence the house of God. In Courts and Palaces he also ReignsAnd in luxurious Cities, where the noyseOf riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,And injury and outrage: And when NightDarkens the streets, then wander forth the sons Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine. Witness the streets of sodom, and that nightIn Gibeah, when hospitable DoresYielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape. These were the prime in order and in might;The rest were long to tell, though far renowned,Th' Ionian Gods, of Javans Issue heldGods, yet confest later then heaven and EarthThir boasted Parents; Titan heavens first born With his enormous brood, and birthright seisedBy younger saturn, he from mightier Jove
        His own and Rhea's son like measure found;so Jove usurping reigned: these first in Creet
        And Ida known, thence on the snowy topOf cold Olympus ruled the middle 〈◊〉
        Thir highest heaven; or on the Delphian Cliff,Or in Dodona, and through all the boundsOf Doric Land; or who with saturn oldFled over Adria to th' Hesperian Fields, And ore the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles. All these and more came flocking; but with looksDown cast and damp, yet such wherein appearedObscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chiefNot in despair, to have found themselves not lostIn loss it self; which on his count'nance castLike doubtful hue: but he his wonted pridesoon recollecting, with high words, that boresemblance of worth not substance, gently raisedTheir fainted courage, and dispeled their fears. Then strait commands that at the warlike soundOf Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreardHis mighty standard; that proud honour claimedAzazel▪
          as his right, a Cherube tall:Who forth with from the glittering staff unfurldTh' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc'tshon like a Meteor streaming to the WindWith Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblazed,seraphic arms and Trophies: all the whilesonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds: At which the universal Host upsentA shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyondFrighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night. All in a moment through the gloom were seenTen thousand Banners rise into the AirWith Orient Colours waving: with them roseA Forrest huge of spears: and thronging HelmsAppeared, and serried shields in thick arrayOf depth immeasurable: Anon they moveIn perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood Of Flutes and soft Recorders; sueh as raisedTo highth of noblest temper Hero's oldArming to Battel, and in stead of rageDeliberate valour breathed, firm and unmovedWith dread of death to flight or foul retreat,Nor wanting power to mitigate and swageWith solemn touches, troubled thoughts, and chaseAnguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and painFrom mortal or immortal minds. Thus theyBreathing united force with fixed thought Moved on in silence to soft Pipes that charmedThir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and nowAdvanc't in view they stand, a horrid FrontOf dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guiseOf Warriers old with ordered spear and shield,Awaiting what command thir mighty ChiefHad to impose: He through the armed FilesDarts his experienc't eye, and soon traverseThe whole Battalion views, thir order due,Thir visages and stature as of Gods, Thir number last he summs. And now his heartDistends with pride, and hardning in his strengthGlories: For never since created man,Met such imbodied force, as named with theseCould merit more then that small infantryWarred on by Cranes: though all the Giant broodOf Phlegra with th' Heroic Race were joynedThat fought at Theb's and Ilium, on each sideMixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resoundsIn Fable or Romance of Uthers son Begirt with British and Armoric Knights;And all who since, Baptized or InfidelJousted in Aspramont or Montalban,
        〈◊〉, or Marocco, or Trebisond,
        Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shoreWhen Charlemain with all his Peerage fellBy Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyondCompare of mortal prowess, yet observedThir dread Commander: he above the restIn shape and gesture proudly eminent stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lostAll her Original brightness, nor appearedLess then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excessOf Glory obscured: As when the sun new ris'nLooks through the Horizontal misty Airshorn of his Beams, or from behind the MoonIn dim Eclips disastrous twilight shedsOn half the Nations, and with fear of changePerplexes Monarchs. Dark'ned so, yet shonAbove them all th' Arch Angel: but his face Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and caresat on his faded cheek, but under BrowesOf dauntless courage, and considerate PrideWaiting revenge: cruel his eye, but castsigns of remorse and passion to beholdThe fellows of his crime, the followers rather(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemnedFor ever now to have their lot in pain,Millions of spirits for his fault amerc'tOf heaven, and from Eternal splendors flung For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens FireHath scathed the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,With singed top their stately growth though barestands on the blasted Heath. He now preparedTo speak; whereat their doubled Ranks they bendFrom Wing to Wing, and half enclose him roundWith all his Peers: attention held them mute. Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last Words interwove with sighs found out their way. O Myriads of immortal spirits, O PowersMatchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strifeWas not inglorious, though th' event was dire,As this place testifies, and this dire changeHateful to utter: but what power of mindForeseeing or presaging, from the DepthOf knowledge past or present, could have feared,How such united force of Gods, how suchAs stood like these, could ever know repulse? For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,That all these puissant Legions, whose exileHath emptied heaven, shall faile to re-ascendself-raised, and repossess their native seat. For me, be witness all the Host of heaven,If counsels different, or danger shunedBy me, have lost our hopes. But he who reignsMonarch in heaven, till then as one securesat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,Consent or custome, and his Regal state Put forth at full, but still his strength concealed,Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. Henceforth his might we know, and know our ownso as not either to provoke, or dreadNew warr, provok't; our better part remainsTo work in close design, by fraud or guileWhat force effected not: that he no lessAt length from us may find, who overcomesBy force, hath overcome but half his foe. space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife There went a fame in Heay'n that he ere longIntended to create, and therein plantA generation, whom his choice regardshould favour equal to the sons of Heaven:Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhapsOur first eruption, thither or elsewhere:For this Infernal Pit shall never holdCaelestial spirits in Bondage, nor th' AbysseLong under darkness cover. But these thoughtsFull Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird, For who can think submission? Warr then, WarrOpen or understood must be resolved. He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flewMillions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighsOf mighty Cherubim; the sudden blazeFar round illumined hell: highly they ragedAgainst the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm'sClashed on their sounding shields the din of war,Hurling defiance toward the vault of heaven. There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top Belched fire and rowling smoak; the rest entireshon with a glossie scurff, undoubted signThat in his womb was hid metallic Ore,The work of sulphur. Thither winged with speedA numerous Brigad hastened As when bandsOf Pioners with spade and Pickaxe armedForerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,Or cast a Rampart. Mammon led them on,Mammon, the least erected spirit that fellFrom heaven, for ev'n in heaven his looks & thoughts Were always downward bent, admiring moreThe riches of heavens pavement, trod'n Gold,Then aught divine or holy else enjoiedIn vision beatific: by him firstMen also, and by his suggestion taught,Ransacked the Center, and with impious handsRifled the bowels of thir mother EarthFor Treasures better hid. soon had his crewOp'nd into the Hill a spacious woundAnd diged out ribs of Gold. Let none admire That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may bestDeserve the pretious bane. And here let thoseWho boast in mortal things, and wondring tellOf Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings,Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,And strength and Art are easily outdoneBy spirits reprobate, and in an hourWhat in an age they with incessant toyleAnd hands innumerable scarce perform. Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepared, That underneath had veins of liquid firesluced from the Lake, a second multitudeWith wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,severing each kinde, and scumed the Bullion dross:A third as soon had formed within the groundA various mould, and from the boyling cellsBy strange conveyance filled each hollow nook,As in an Organ from one blast of windTo many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths. A non out of the earth a Fabrick huge Rose like an Exhalation, with the soundOf Dulcet symphonies and voices sweet,Built like a Temple, where Pilasters roundWere set, and Doric pillars overlaidWith Golden Architrave; nor did there wantCornice or Freeze; with bossy sculptures grav'n,The Roof was fretted Gold. Not Babilon,
        Nor great Alcairo such magnificenceEqualed in all thir glories, to inshrineBelus or serapis thir Gods, or seat Thir Kings, when Aegypt with Assyria stroveIn wealth and luxurie. Th' ascending pilestood fixt her stately highth, and strait the doresOp'ning thir brazen foulds discover wideWithin, her ample spaces, o're the smoothAnd level pavement: from the arched roofPendant by suttle Magic many a rowOf starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fedWith Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded lightAs from a sky. The hasty multitude Admiring entered, and the work some praiseAnd some the Architect: his hand was knownIn heaven by many a Towred structure high,Where sceptered Angels held thir residence,And sat as Princes, whom the supreme KingExalted to such power, and gave to rule,Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright. Nor was his name unheard or unadoredIn ancient Greece; and in Ausonian landMen called him Mulciber; and how he fell From heaven, they fabled, thrown by angry Jove
        sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements: from MornTo Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,A summers day; and with the setting sunDropt from the Zenith like a falling star,On Lomnos th' Aegaean Ile: thus they relate,Erring; for he with this rebellious routFell long before; nor aught availed him nowTo have built in heaven high Towrs; nor did he scapeBy all his Engins, but was headlong sent With his industrious 〈◊〉 to build in 〈◊〉.

More destroied then thusWe should be quite abolisht and expire. What fear we then? what doubt we to incenseHis utmost ire? which to the highth enraged,Will either quite consume us, and reduceTo nothing this essential, happier farrThen miserable to have eternal being:Or if our substance be indeed Divine,And cannot cease to be, we are at worst On this side nothing; and by proof we feelOur power sufficient to disturb his heaven,And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:Which if not Victory is yet Revenge. He ended frowning, and his look denouncedDesperate revenge, and Battel dangerousTo less then Gods. On th' other side up roseBelial, in act more graceful and humane;A fairer person lost not heaven; he seemd For dignity composed and high exploit:But all was false and hollow; though his TongueDropt Manna, and could make the worse appearThe better reason, to perplex and dashMaturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;To vice industrious, but to Nobler deedsTimorous and slothful: yet he pleased the eare,And with perswasive accent thus began. I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,As not behind in hate; if what was urged Main reason to perswade immediate Warr,Did not disswade me most, and seem to castOminous conjecture on the whole success:When he who most excels in fact of Arms,In what he counsels and in what excelsMistrustful, grounds his courage on despairAnd utter dissolution, as the scopeOf all his aim, after some dire revenge.

        One day upon our heads; while we perhapsDesigning or exhorting glorious Warr,Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurled Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and preyOf racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunkUnder yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;There to converse with everlasting groans,Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. Warr therefore, open or concealed, alikeMy voice disswades; for what can force or guileWith him, or who deceive his mind, whose eyeViews all things at one view? he from heavens highth All these our motions vain, sees and derides;Not more Almighty to resist our mightThen wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. shall we then live thus vile, the race of heavenThus trampled, thus expelled to suffer hereChains & these Tor•…ents? better these then worseBy my advice; since fate inevitablesubdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe,Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust That so ordains: this was at first resolved,If we were wise, against so great a foeContending, and so doubtful what might fall. I laugh, when those who at the spear are boldAnd 〈◊◊〉, if that fail them, shrink and fearWhat yet they know must follow, to endureExile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,The sentence of thir 〈◊〉: This is nowOur doom; which if we can sustain and bear,Our supream Foe in time may much remit His anger, and perhaps thus farr removedNot mind us not offending, satisfiedWith what is punish't; whence these raging firesWill slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames. Our purer essenee then will overcomeThir noxious vapour, or enured not feel,Or changed at length, and to the place conformdIn temper and in nature, will receiveFamiliar the fierce heat, and void of pain;This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, Besides what hope the never ending flightOf future days maybring, what chance, what changeWorth waiting, since our present lot appeersFor happy though but ill, for ill not worst,If we procure not to our •…lves more woe. Thus Belial with words cloathed in reasons garbCounseled ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake. Either to disinthrone the King of heavenWe warr, if war•… be best, or to regain Our own right lost: him to unthrone we thenMay hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeildTo fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife:The former vain to hope argues as vainThe latter: for what place can be for usWithin heavens bound, unless heavens Lord supreamWe overpower? suppose he should relentAnd publish Grace to all, on promise madeOf new subjection; with what eyes could westand in his presence humble, and receive strict Laws imposed, to celebrate his Throne▪
        With warbled Hymns, and to his Godhead singForc't Halleluiah's; while he Lordly sitsOur envied sovran, and his Altar breathesAmbrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,Our servile offerings. This must be our taskIn heaven, this our delight; how wearisomEternity so spent in worship paidTo whom we hate. Let us not then pursueBy force impossible, by leave obtained Unacceptable, though in heaven, our stateOf splendid vassalage, but rather seekOur own good from our selves, and from our ownLive to our selves, though in this vast recess,Free, and to none accountable, preferringHard liberty before the easie yokeOf servile Pomp. Our greatness will appearThen most conspicuous, when great things of small,Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverseWe can create, and in what place so e're Thrive under evil, and work ease out of painThrough labour and endurance. This deep worldOf darkness do we dread? How oft amidstThick clouds and dark doth heavens all-ruling sireChoose to reside, his Glory unobscured,And with the Majesty of darkness roundCovers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roarMust'ring thir rage, and heaven resembles Hell?As he our Darkness, cannot we his LightImitate when we please? This Desart soile Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raiseMagnificence; and what can heaven shew more?Our torments also may in length of timeBecome our Elements, these piercing FiresAs soft as now severe, our temper changedInto their temper; which must needs removeThe sensible of pain. All things inviteTo peaceful Counsels, and the settled stateOf order, how in safety best we may Compose our present evils, with regardOf what we are and where, dismissing quiteAll thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise. He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filldTh' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retainThe sound of blustring winds, which all night longHad roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence lullsea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chanceOr Pinnace anchors in a craggy BayAfter the Tempest: such applause was heard As Mammon ended, and his sentence pleased,Advising peace: for fuch another FieldThey dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fearOf Thunder and the sword of Michael
        Wrought still within them; and no less desireTo found this nether Empire, which might riseBy pollicy, and long process of time,In emulation opposite to heaven. Which when Bëëlzebub perceived, then whom,satan except, none higher sat, with grave Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemedA Pillar of state; deep on his Front engravenDeliberation sat and publick care;And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,Majestick though in ruin: sage he stoodWith Atlantean shoulders fit to bearThe weight of mightiest Monarchies; his lookDrew audience and attention still as NightOr summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake. Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heaven, Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles nowMust we renounce, and changing stile be calledPrinces of Hell? for so the popular voteInclines, here to continue, and build up hereA growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,And know not that the King of heaven hath doomedThis place our dungeon, not our safe retreatBeyond his Potent arm, to live exemptFrom heavens high jurisdiction, in new LeagueBanded against his Throne, but to remaine In strictest bondage, though thus far removed,Under th' inevitable curb, reservedHis captive multitude: For he, be sure,In highth or depth, still first and last will Reignsole King, and of his Kingdom loose no partBy our revolt, but over Hell extendHis Empire, and with Iron scepter ruleUs here, as with his Golden those in heaven. What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr?Warr hath determined us, and foild with loss Irreparable; tearms of peace yet noneVoutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'nTo us enslaved, but custody severe,And stripes, and arbitrary punishmentInflicted? and what peace can we return,But to our power hostility and hate,Untamed reluctance, and revenge though slow,Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour leastMay reap his conquest, and may least rejoyceIn doing what we most in suffering feel? Nor will occasion want, nor shall we needWith dangerous expedition to invadeheaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege,Or ambush from the Deep. What if we findsome easier enterprize? There is a place(If ancient and prophetic fame in heavenErr not) another World, the happy seatOf som new Race called Man, about this timeTo be created like to us, though lessIn power and excellence, but favoured more Of him who rules above; so was his willPronounced among the Gods, and by an Oath,That shook heavens whol circumference, confirmed. Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learnWhat creatures there inhabit, of what mould,Or substance, how endued, and what thir Power,And where thir weakness, how attempted best,By force or suttlety: Though heaven be shut,And heavens high Arbitrator sit secureIn his own strength, this place may lye exposed The utmost border of his Kingdom, leftTo their defence who hold it: here perhapssom advantagious act may be achievedBy sudden onset, either with Hell sireTo waste his whole Creation, or possessAll as our own, and drive as we were driven,The punie habitants, or if not drive,seduce them to our Party, that thir GodMay prove thir foe, and with repenting handAbolish his own works. This would surpass Common revenge, and interrupt his joyIn our Confusion, and our Joy upraiseIn his disturbance; when his dar•…ing sonsHurled headlong to partake with us, shall curseThir frail Originals, and faded bliss,Faded so soon. Advise if this be worthAttempting, or to sit in darkness hereHatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub
        Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devisedBy s•…tan, and in part proposed: for whence, But from the Author of all ill could springso deep a malice, to confound the raceOf mankind in one root, and Earth with HellTo mingle and involve, done all to spiteThe great Creatour? But thir spite still servesHis glory to augment. The bold designPleased highly those infernal states, and joysparkled in all thir eyes; with full assentThey vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. Well have ye judged, well ended long debate, synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,Great things resolved; which from the lowest deepWill once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,Neerer our ancient seat; perhaps in viewOf those bright confines, whence with neighb•…uring ArmsAnd opportune excursion we may chanceRe-enter heaven; or else in some milde ZoneDwell not unvisited of heavens fair Lightsecure, and at the brightning O•…ient beamPurge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, To heal the •…earr of these corrosive Firesshall breath her balme. But first whom shall we sendIn search of this new world, whom shall we findsufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feetThe dark unbottomed infinite AbyssAnd through the palpable obscure find outHis uncouth way, or spread his aerie flightUpborn with indefatigable wingsOver the vast abrupt, ere he arriveThe happy Ile; what strength, what art can then suffice, or what evasion bear him safeThrough the strict senteries and stations thickOf Angels watching round? Here he had needAll circumspection, and we now no lessChoice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,The weight of all and our last hope relies,This said, he sat; and expectation heldHis look suspence, awaiting who appeeredTo second, or oppose, or undertakeThe perilous attempt: but all sat mute, Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; & eachIn others count'nance red his own dismayAstonisht: none among the choice and primeOf those heaven-warring Champions could be foundso hardie as to proffer or acceptAlone the dreadful voyage; till at lastsatan, whom now 〈◊〉 glory 〈◊〉
        Above his fellows, with Monarchal prideConscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake. O Progeny of heaven, Empyreal Thrones, With reason hath deep silence and demur•…
        seised us, though undismaid: long is the wayAnd hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light;Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,Outrageous to devour, immures us roundNinefold, and gates of burning AdamantBarred over us prohibit all egress. These past, if any pass, the void profoundOf unessential Night receives him nextWide gaping, and with utter lo•…s of being Threatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf. If thence he scape into what ever world,Or unknown Region, what remains him lessThen unknown dangers and as hard escape. But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,And this Imperial sov'ranty, adornedWith splendor, armed with power, if aught proposedAnd judged of public moment, in the shapeOf difficulty or danger could deterreMe from attempting. Wherefore do I assume These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,Refusing to accept as great a shareOf hazard as of honour, due alikeTo him who Reigns, and so much to him dueOf hazard more, as he above the restHigh honourd sits? Go therfore mighty powers,Terror of heaven, though fall'n; intend at home,While here shall be our home, what best may easeThe present misery, and render Hell More toller•…ble; if there be cure or charmTo respite or deceive, or slack the painOf this ill Mansion: intermit no watchAgainst a wakeful Foe, while I abroadThrough all the coasts of dark destruction seekDeliverance for us all: this enterprizeNone shall partake with me. Thus saying roseThe Monarch, and prevented all reply,Prudent, least from his resolution raisedOthers among the chief might offer now(Certain to be refused) what erst they feard; And so refused might in opinion standHis rivals, winning cheap the high reputeWhich he through hazard huge must earn. But theyDreaded not more th' adventure then his voiceForbidding; and at once with him they rose;Thir rising all at once was as the soundOf Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bendWith awful reverence prone; and as a GodExtoll him equal to the highest in heaven:Nor failed they to express how much they praised, That for the general safety he despisedHis own: for neither do the spirits damnedLoose all thir vertue; least bad men should boastThir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,Or close ambition varnisht o're with zeal. Thus they thir doubtful consultations darkEnded rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:As when from mountain tops the dusky cloudsAscending, while the North wind sleeps, o'respreadheavens chearful face, the lowring Element scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip snow, or showre;If chance the radiant sun with farewell sweetExtend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive,The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herdsAttest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. O shame to men! Devil with Devil damnedFirm concord holds, men onely disagreeOf Creatures rational, though under hopeOf heavenly Grace: and God 〈◊〉 peace,Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife Among themselves, and levie cruel warres,Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy:As if (which might induce us to accord)Man had not hellish foes anow besides,That day and night for his destruction waite. The stygian Councel thus dissolved; and forthIn order came the grand 〈◊〉 Peers,Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemdAlone th' Antagonist of heaven, nor lessThen Hells dread Emperour with pomp supream, And God-like imitated state; him roundA Globe of fierie seraphim inclosedWith bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. Then of thir session ended they bid cryWith Trumpets regal sound the great result:Toward the four winds four speedy CherubimPut to thir mouths the sounding 〈◊〉
        By Haralds voice explained: the 〈◊〉 AbyssHeard farr and wide, and all the host of HellWith deafning shout, returned them loud acclaim. Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat raisedBy false presumptuous hope, the ranged powersDisband, and wandring, each his several wayPursues, as inclination or sad choiceLeads him perplext, where he may likeliest 〈◊〉
        Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertainThe irksome hours, till his great Chief return. Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublimeUpon the wing, or in swift race contend,As at th' Olympian Games or Pythian fields; Part curb thir fierie steeds, or shun the GoalWith rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. As when to warn proud Cities warr appearsWaged in the troubled skie, and Armies rushTo Battel in the Clouds, before each VanPri•… forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spearsTill thickest Legions close; with feats of ArmsFrom either end of heaven the welkin burns. Others with vast 〈◊〉 rage more fellRend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. As when Alcides from Oealia CrownedWith conquest, felt th' envenomed robe, and toreThrough pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines,And 〈◊〉, from the top of 〈◊〉 threwInto th' Euboic sea. Others more milde,Retreated in a silent valley, singWith notes Angelical to many a HarpThir own Heroic deeds and hapless fallBy doom of Battel; and complain that Fate Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. Thir song was partial, but the harmony(What could it less when spirits immortal sing?)suspended H•…ll, and took with ravishmentThe thronging audience. In discourse more sweet(For Eloquence the soul, song charms the sense,)Others apart sat on a Hill retired,In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned highOf 〈◊〉, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,Fixt Fate, 〈◊〉 will, fore knowledge absolute, And found •…o end, in wandring mazes lost. Of good and evil much they argued then,Of happiness and final misery,Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame,Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charmPain for a while or anguish, and exciteFallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brestWith stubborn patience as with triple steel. Another part in squadrons and gross Bands, On bold adventure to discover wideThat dismal world, if any Clime perhaps▪
        Might yeild them easier habitation, bendFour ways thir flying March, along the BanksOf four infernal Rivers that disgorgeInto the burning Lake thir baleful streams;Abhorred styx the flood of deadly hate,sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;Cocytus, named of lamentation loudHeard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton 
        Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. Farr off from these a slow and silent stream,Lethe the River of Oblivion roulesHer watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,Forthwith his former state and being forgets,Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. Beyond this flood a frozen ContinentLies dark and wilde, beat with perpetnal stormsOf Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm landThaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,A gulf profound as that serbonian BogBetwixt Damiata and mount Casius old,Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching AirBurns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire. Thither by harpy-footed Furies hailed,At certain revolutions all the damnedAre brought: and feel by turns the bitter changeOf fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce,From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pineImmovable, infixt, and frozen round,Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. They ferry over this Lethean soundBoth to and fro, thir sorrow to augment,And wish and struggle, as they pass▪ to reachThe tempting stream▪ with one small drop to looseIn sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,All in one moment, and so neer the brink;But fate withstands, and to oppose th▪ attempt Medusa with Gorgonian terror guardsThe Ford, and of it self the water fliesAll taste of living wight, as once it fledThe lip of Tantalus. Thus roving onIn confused march forlorn, th' adventrous BandsWith shuddring horror pale, and eyes agastViewed first thir lamentable lot, and foundNo rest: through many a dark and drearie VaileThey passed, and many a Region dolorous,O're many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe▪

O Father, gracious was that word which closedThy sov•… sentence, that Man should find grace;For which both heaven and Earth shall high extollThy praises, with th' innumerable soundOf Hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy ThroneEncompassed shall resound thee ever blest.

This my long sufferance and my day of graceThey who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;But hard be hard'nd, blind be blinded more, That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;And none but such from mercy I exclude. But yet all is not don; Man disobeying,Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinnsAgainst the high supremacie of heaven,Affecting God-head, and so loosing all,To expiate his Treason hath naught left,But to destruction sacred and devote,He with his whole posteritie must die,Die hee or Justice must; unless for him som other able, and as willing, payThe rigid satisfaction, death for death. say heavenly Powers, where shall we find such love,Which of ye will be mortal to redeemMans mortal crime, and just th' unjust to save,Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare?He asked, but all the heavenly Quire stood mute,And silence was in heaven: on mans behalfPatron or Intercessor none appeerd,Much less that durst upon his own head draw The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. And now without redemption all mankindMust have bin lost, adjudged to Death and HellBy doom severe, had not the son of God,In whom the fulness dwels of love divine,His dearest mediation thus renewd.

There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhapsAftronomer in the sun's lucent OrbeThrough his glazed Optic Tube yet never saw. The place he found beyond expression bright,Compared with aught on Earth, Medal or stone;Not all parts like, but all alike informdWhich radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;If mettal, part seemd Gold, part silver cleer;If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shonIn Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besidesImagind rather oft then elsewhere seen,That stone, or like to that which here below Philosophers in vain so long have sought,In vain, though by thir powerful Art they bindeVolatil Hermes, and call up unboundIn various shapes old Proteus from the sea,Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. What wonder then if fields and regions hereBreathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers runPotable Gold, when with one vertuous touchTh' Arch-chimic sun so farr from us remoteProduces with Terrestrial Humor mixt Here in the dark so many precious thingsOf colour glorious and effect so rare?Here matter new to gaze the Devil metUndazled, farr and wide his eye commands,For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,But all sun-shine, as when his Beams at NoonCulminate from th' Aequator, as they nowshot upward still direct, whence no way roundshadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire,No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray To objects distant farr, whereby he soonsaw within kenn a glorious Angel stand,The same whom John saw also in the sun:His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid;Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiarCircled his Head, nor less his Locks behindIllustrious on his shoulders fledge with wingsLay waving round; on som great charge imploiedHee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep.

Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to knowThe works of God, thereby to glorifieThe great Work-Maister, leads to no excessThat reaches blame, but rather merits praiseThe more it seems excess, that led thee hitherFrom thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone,To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps Contented with report heare onely in heaven:For wonderful indeed are all his works,Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be allHad in remembrance alwayes with delight;But what created mind can comprehendThir number, or the wisdom infiniteThat brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. I saw when at his Word the formless Mass,This worlds material mould, came to a heap:Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar stood ruled, stood vast infinitude confined;Till at his second bidding darkness fled,Light shon, and order from disorder sprung:swift to thir several Quarters hasted thenThe cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire,And this Ethereal quintessence of heavenFlew upward, spirited with various forms,That rowld 〈◊〉, and turnd to starrsNumberless, as thou seest, and how they move;Each had his place appointed, each his course, The rest in circuit walles this Universe.

That spot to which I point is Paradise,
        Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. Thus said, he turnd, and satan bowing low,As to superior spirits is wont in Heaven,Where honour due and reverence none neglects,Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath,Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hoped success,Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele, Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.

O For that warning voice, which he who sawTh' Apocalyps, heard cry in Heaven aloud,Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,Came furious down to be revenged on men,Wo to the inhabitants on Earth! that now,While time was, our first Parents had bin warndThe coming of thir secret foe, and scapedHaply so scaped his mortal snare; for nowsatan, now first inflamed with rage, came down,The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind, To wreck on innocent frail man his lossOf that first Battel, and his flight to Hell:Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold,Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birthNow rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest,And like a devillish Engine back recoilesUpon himself; horror and doubt distractHis troubled thoughts, and from the bottom stirrThe Hell within him, for within him Hell He brings, and round about him, nor from HellOne step no more then from himself can flyBy change of place: Now conscience wakes despairThat slumberd, wakes the bitter memorieOf what he was, what is, and what must beWorse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. sometimes towards Eden which now in his viewLay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,sometimes towards heaven and the full blazing sun,Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre: Then much revolving, thus in sighs began. O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd,Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the GodOf this new World; at whose sight all the starrsHide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call,But with no friendly voice, and add thy nameO sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beamsThat bring to my remembrance from what stateI fell, how glorious once above thy spheare;Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down Warring in heaven against heavens matchless King:Ah wherefore! he deservd no such returnFrom me, whom he created what I wasIn that bright eminence, and with his goodUpbraided none; nor was his service hard. What could be less then to afford him praise,The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,How due! yet all his good proved ill in me,And wrought but malice; lifted up so highI sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher Would set me highest, and in a moment quitThe debt immense of endless gratitude,so burthensome, still paying, still to ow;Forgetful what from him I still receivd,And understood not that a grateful mindBy owing owes not, but still pays, at onceIndebted and dischargd; what burden then?O had his powerful Destiny ordaindMe some inferiour Angel, I had stoodThen happie; no unbounded hope had raised Ambition. Yet why not? som other PowerAs great might have aspired, and me though meanDrawn to his part; but other Powers as greatFell not, but stand unshak'n, from withinOr from without, to all temptations armed. Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand?Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,But heavens free Love dealt equally to all?Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate,To me alike, it deals eternal woe. Nay cursed be thou; since against his thy willChose freely what it now so justly rues. Me miserable! which way shall I flieInfinite wrauth, and infinite despaire?Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell;And in the lowest deep a lower deepstill threatning to devour me opens wide,To which the Hell I suffer seems a heaven. O then at last relent: is there no placeLeft for Repentance, none for Pardon left? None left but by submission; and that wordDisdain forbids me, and my dread of shameAmong the spirits beneath, whom I seducedWith other promises and other vauntsThen to submit, boasting I could subdueTh' Omnipotent. Ay me, they little knowHow dearly I abide that boast so vaine,Under what torments inwardly I groane:While they adore me on the Throne of Hell,With Diadem and scepter high advanc't The lower still I fall, onely supreamIn miserie; such joy Ambition findes. But say I could repent and could obtaineBy Act of Grace my former state; how soonWould highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsayWhat feigned submission swore: ease would recantVows made in pain, as violent and void. For never can true reconcilement growWhere wounds of deadly hate have peirced so deep:Which would but lead me to a worse relapse, And heavier fall: so should I purchase deareshort intermission bought with double smart. This knows my punisher; therefore as farrFrom granting hee, as I from begging peace:All hope excluded thus, behold in steadOf us out-cast, exiled, his new delight,Mankind created, and for him this World. so farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear,Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost;Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least Divided Empire with heavens King I holdBy thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne;As Man ere long, and this new World shall know.

As I bent down to look, just opposite, A shape within the watry gleam appeerdBending to look on me, I started back,It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd,Pleased it returnd as soon with answering looksOf sympathie and love, there I had fixtMine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire,Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest,What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self,With thee it came and goes: but follow me,And I will bring thee where no shadow staies Thy coming; and thy soft imbraces, heeWhose image thou art, him thou shall enjoyInseparablie thine, to him shalt beareMultitudes like thy self, and thence be calledMother of human Race: what could I doe,But follow strait, invisibly thus led?Till I espied thee, fair indeed and tall,Under a Platan, yet methought less faire,Less winning soft, less amiablie milde,Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd, Thou following cryd'st aloud, Return fair Eve,

Mean while in utmost Longitude, where heavenWith Earth and Ocean meets, the setting sun slowly descended, and with right aspectAgainst the eastern Gate of ParadiseLeveld his eevning Rayes: it was a RockOf Alablaster, piled up to the Clouds,Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascentAccessible from Earth, one entrance high;The rest was craggie cliff, that overhungstill as it rose, impossible to climbe.

Thither came Uriel, gliding through the EevenOn a sun beam, swift as a shooting starrIn Autumn thwarts the night, when vapors firedImpress the Air, and shews the MarinerFrom what point of his Compass to bewareImpetuous winds: he thus began in haste. Gabriel, to thee thy cours by Lot hath giv'nCharge and strict watch that to this happie placeNo evil thing approach or enter in;This day at highth of Noon came to my spheareA spirit, zealous, as he seemed, to knowMore of th' Almighties works, and chiefly ManGods latest Image: I described his wayBent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate;But in the Mount that lies from Eden North,Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks Alien from heaven, with passions foul obscured:Mine eye pursued him still, but under shadeLost sight of him; one of the banisht crewI fear, hath ventured from the deep, to raiseNew troubles; him thy care must be to find.

With thee conversing I forget all time,All seasons and thir change, all please alike. sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the sunWhen first on this delightful Land he spreadsHis orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour,Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earthAfter soft showers; and sweet the coming onOf grateful Eevning milde, then silent NightWith this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon,And these the Gemms of heaven, her starrie train:But neither breath of Morn when she ascends With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising sunOn this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure,Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers,Nor grateful Evening mild, nor silent NightWith this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon,Or glittering starr-light without thee is sweet. But wherfore all night long shine these, for whomThis glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?To whom our general Ancestor replied. Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht Eve, 
        Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth,By morrow Eevning, and from Land to LandIn order, though to Nations yet unborn,Ministring light prepared, they set and rise;Least total darkness should by Night regaineHer old possession, and extinguish lifeIn Nature and all things, which these soft firesNot only enlighten, but with kindly heateOf various influence foment and warme,Temper or nourish, or in part shed down Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that growOn Earth, made hereby apter to receivePerfection from the suns more potent Ray. These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none,That heaven would want spectators, God want praise;Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the EarthUnseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:All these with ceasless praise his works beholdBoth day and night: how often from the steep Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heardCelestial voices to the midnight air,sole, or responsive each to others notesinging thir great Creator: oft in bandsWhile they keep watch, or nightly rounding walkWith heavenly touch of instrumental soundsIn full harmonic number joind, thir songsDivide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. Thus talking hand in hand alone they passedOn to thir blissful Bower; it was a place Chos'n by the sovran Planter, when he framedAll things to mans delightful use; the roofeOf thickest covert was inwoven shadeLaurel and Mirtle, and what higher grewOf firm and fragrant leaf; on either sideAcanthus, and each odorous bushie shrubFenced up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, wroughtIris all hues, Roses, and GessaminReared high thir flourisht heads between, andMosaic; underfoot the Violet, Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlayBroiderd the ground, more coloured then with stoneOf costliest Emblem: other Creature hereBeast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none;such was thir awe of man. In shadier BowerMore sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd,Pan or silvanus never slept, nor Nymph,Nor Faunus haunted. Here in close recessWith Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling HerbsEspoused Eve deckt first her Nuptial Bed, And heavenly Quires the Hymenaean sung,What day the genial Angel to our sireBrought her in naked beauty more adorned,More lovely then Pandora, whom the GodsEndowd with all thir gifts, and O too likeIn sad event, when to the unwiser sonOf Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnaredMankind with her faire looks, to be avengedOn him who had stole Joves authentic fire.

These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept,And on thir naked limbs the flourie roofshowrd Roses, which the Morn repaired. sleep on,Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seekNo happier state, and know to know no more. Now had night measured with her shaddowieConeHalf way up Hill this vast sublunar Vault,And from thir Ivorie Port the CherubimForth issuing at th'accustomd hour stood armd To thir night watches in warlike Parade,When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the southWith strictest watch; these other wheel the North,Our circuit meets full West. As flame they partHalf wheeling to the shield, half to the spear. From these, two strong and suttle spirits he calldThat neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. Ithuriel and Zephon, with wingd speedsearch through this Garden, leav unsearcht no nook, But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge,Now laid perhaps asleep secure of har•…e. This Eevning from the sun's decline arrivedWho tells of som infernal spirit seenHitherward bent (who could have thought?) escapedThe barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. so saying, on he led his radiant Files,Daz'ling the Moon; these to the Bower directIn search of whom they sought: him there they found squat like a Toad, close at the eare of Eve;
        Assaying by his Devilish art to reachThe Organs of her Fancie, and with them forgeIllusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,Or if, inspiring venom, he might taintTh' animal spirits that from pure blood ariseLike gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raiseAt least distemperd, discontented thoughts,Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desiresBlown up with high conceits ingendring pride. Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spearTouched lightly; for no falshood can endureTouch of Celestial temper; but returnsOf sorce to its own likeness: up he startsDiscoverd and surprized. As when a sparkLights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laidFit for the Tun som Magazin to storeAgainst a rumord Warr, the smuttie graineWith sudden blaze diffused, inflames the Aire:so started up in his own shape the Fiend. Back stept those two fair Angels h•…lf amazedso sudden to behold the grieslie King;Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. Which of those rebell spirits adjudged to HellCom'st thou, escaped thy prison, and transformed,Why satst thou like an enemie in waiteHere watching at the head of these that sleep?Know ye not then said satan, filld with scorn,Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mateFor you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; Not to know mee argue; your selves unknown,The lowest of your throng; or if ye know,Why ask ye, and superfluous beginYour message, like to end as much in vain?To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. Think not, revolted spirit, thy sh•…pe the same,Or undiminisht brightness, to be knownAs when thou stoodst in heaven upright and pure;That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good,Departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. But come, for thou, besure, shalt give accountTo him who sent us, whose charge is to keepThis place inviolable, and these from harm. so spake the Cherube, and his grave rebukesevere in youthful beautie, added graceInvincible: abasht the Devil stood,And felt how awful goodness is, and sawVertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pinedHis loss; but chiefly to find here observd His lustre visibly impared; yet seemdUndaunted. If I must contend, said he,Best with the best, the sender not the sent,Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn,Or less be lost. Thy fear, said Zephon bold,Will save us trial what the least can doesingle against thee wicked, and thence weak. The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage;But like a proud steed reind, went hautie on,Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie He held it vain; awe from above had quelldHis heart, not else dismaied. Now drew they nighThe western point, where those half-rounding guardsJust met, & closing stood in squadron joindAwaiting next command. To whom thir ChiefGabriel from the Front thus calld aloud. O friends, I hear the tread of nimble fêetHasting this way, and now by glimps discerneIthuriel and Zephon through the shade,And with them comes a third of Regal port, But faded splendor wan; who by his gateAnd fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,Not likely to part hence without c•…test;stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. He scarce had ended, when those two approachdAnd brief related whom they brought, wher found,How busied, in what form and posture coucht. To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. Why hast thou, satan, broke the bounds prescribedTo thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge Of others, who approve not to transgressBy thy example, but have power and rightTo question thy bold entrance on this place;Imploied it seems to violate sleep, and thoseWhose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?To whom thus satan with contemptuous brow. Gabriel, thou hadst in heaven th' esteem of wise,And such I held thee; but this question asktPuts me in doubt. Lives ther who loves his pain?Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt,And boldly venture to whatever placeFarthest from pain, where thou mig•…tsti hope to changeTorment with ease, & soonest recompenceDole with delight, which in this place I sought;To thee no reason; who knowst only good,But evil hast not tried: and wilt objectHis will who bound us? let him surer barrHis Iron Gates, if he intends our stayIn that dark durance: thus much what was askt. The rest is true, they found me where they say;But that implies not violence or harme. Thus hee in scorn. The warlike Angel moved,Disdainfully half smiling thus replied. O loss of one in heaven to judge of wise,since satan fell, whom follie overthrew,And now returns him from his prison scap't,Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wiseOr not, who ask what boldness brought him hitherUnlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescribed; so wise he judges it to sly from painHowever, and to sĉape his punishment. so judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flightseavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,Which taught thee yet no better, that no painCan equal anger infinite provok't. But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with theeCame not all Hell broke loose? is pain to themLess pain, less to be fled, or thou then they Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief,The first in flight from pain, had'st thou allegedTo thy deserted host this cause of flight,Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.

Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stoodThy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aideThe blasting volied Thunder made all speedAnd seconded thy else not dreaded spear.

To whom the warriour Angel soon replied.

O Adam, one Almightie is, from whom All things proceed, and up to him return,If not depraved from good, created allsuch to perfection, one first matter all,Indued with various forms, various degreesOf substance, and in things that live, of life;But more refined, more spiritous, and pure,As neerer to him plac't or neerer tendingEach in thir several active sphears assignd,Till body up to spirit work, in boundsProportiond to each kind. so from the rootsprings lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves More aerie, last the bright consummate flourespirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruitMans nourishment, by gradual scale sublimedTo vital spirits aspire, to animal,To intellectual, give both life and sense,Fansie and understanding, whence the souleReason receives, and reason is her being,Discursive, or Intuitive; discourseIs oftest yours, the latter most is ours,Differing but in degree, of kind the same.

Mean while enjoyYour fill what happiness this happie stateCan comprehend, incapable of more. To whom the Patriarch of mankind replied. O favourable spirit, propitious guest,Well hast thou taught the way that might directOur knowledge, and the scale of Nature setFrom center to circumference, whereon In contemplation of created thingsBy steps we may ascend to God. But say,What meant that caution joind, if ye be found
        Obedient? can wee want obedience thenTo him, or possibly his love desertWho formd us from the dust, and placed us hereFull to the •…tmost measure of what blissHuman desires can seek or apprehend?To whom the Angel. son of heaven and Earth,Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God; That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self,That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.

Because wee freely love, as in our willTo love or not; in this we stand or fall: And som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n,And so from heaven to deepest Hell; O fallFrom what high state of bliss into what woe!To whom our great Progenitor.

Thus Adam made request, and Raphael
        After short pause assenting, thus began.

Thus when in OrbesOf circuit inexpressible they stood,Orb within Orb, the Father infinite,By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the son,A midst as from a flaming Mount, whoseopBrightness had made invisible, thus spake.

Again, God said, let ther be FirmamentAmid the Waters, and let it divideThe Waters from the Waters: and God madeThe Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,Transparent, Elemental Air, diffusedIn circuit to the uttermost convexOf this great Round: partition firm and sure,The Waters underneath from those aboveDividing: for as Earth, so hee the WorldBuilt on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misruleOf Chaos farr removed, least fierce extreamesContiguous might distemper the whole frame:And heaven he named the Firmament: so Eev'nAnd Morning Chorus sung the second Day.

The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacleOf congregated Waters he called seas:And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' EarthPut forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding seed, And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind;Whose seed is in her self upon the Earth. He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till thenDesert and bare, unsightly, unadorned,Brought forth the tender Grass▪ whose verdure cladHer Universal Face with pleasant green,Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flouredOp'ning thir various colours, and made gayHer bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown,Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie ReedEmbattelled in her field: add the humble shrub,And Bush with frizled hair implicit: lastRose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spredThir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemmedThir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd,With tufts the vallies & each fountain side,With borders long the Rivers.

And God made two great Lights, great for thir useTo Man, the greater to have rule by Day,The less by Night alterne: and made the starrs,And set them in the Firmament of heavenTo illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night,And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw,surveying his great Work, that it was good:For of Celestial Bodies first the sunA mightie spheare he framed, unlight som first,Though of Ethereal Mould: then formed the MoonGlobose, and everie magnitude of starrs,And sowd with starrs the heaven thick as a field:Of Light by farr the greater part he took,Transplanted from her cloudie shrine, and placed •…n the suns Orb, made porous to receiveAnd drink the liquid Light, firm to retaineHer gathered beams, great Palace now of Light.

Yet went she not, as not with such discourseDelighted, or not capable her eareOf what was high: such pleasure she reserved,Adam relating, she sole Auditress;Her Husband the Relater she preferredBefore the Angel, and of him to ask Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermixGrateful digressions, and solve high disputeWith conjugal Caresses, from his LipNot Words alone pleased her. O when meet nowsuch pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyned?With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went;Not unattended, for on her as QueenA pomp of winning Graces waited still,And from about her shot Darts of desireInto all Eyes to wish her still in sight. And Raphael now to Adam's doubt proposedBenevolent and facil thus replied. To ask or search I blame thee not, for heavenIs as the Book of God before thee set,Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learneHis seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Yeares:This to attain, whether heaven move or Earth,Imports not, if thou reck'n right, the restFrom Man or Angel the great ArchitectDid wisely to conceal, and not divulge His secrets to be scanned by them who oughtRather admire; or if they list to tryConjecture, he his Fabric of the heavensHath left to thir disputes, perhaps to moveHis laughter at thir quaint Opinions wideHereafter, when they come to model heavenAnd calculate the starrs, how they will weildThe mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contriveTo save appeerances, how gird the sphearWith Centric and Eccentric scribled o're, Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb:Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess,Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposestThat Bodies bright and greater should not serveThe less not bright, nor heaven such journies run,Earth sitting still, when she alone receavesThe benefit: consider first, that GreatOr Bright inferrs not Excellence: the EarthThough, in comparison of heaven, so small,Nor glistering, may of solid good containe More plenty then the sun that barren shines,Whose vertue on it self workes no effect,But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavdHis beams, unactive else, thir vigor find. Yet not to Earth are those bright LuminariesOfficious, but to thee Earths habitant. And for the heavens wide Circuit, let it speakThe Makers high magnificence, who builtso spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr;That Man may know he dwells not in his own; An Edifice too large for him to fill,Lodged in a small partition, and the restOrdained for uses to his Lord best known. The swiftness of those Circles attribute,Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,That to corporeal substances could addespeed almost spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow,Who since the Morning hour set out from heavenWhere God resides, and ere mid-day arrivedIn Eden, distance inexpressible By Numbers that have name. But this I urge,Admitting Motion in the heavens, to shewInvalid that which thee to doubt it moved;Not that I so affirm, though so it seemTo thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. God to remove his wayes from human sense,Placed heaven from Earth so farr, that earthly sight,If it presume, might erre in things too high,And no advantage gaine. What if the sunBe Center to the World, and other starrs By his attractive vertue and thir ownIncited, dance about him various rounds?Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid,Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,In six thou seest, and what if sev'nth to theseThe Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem,Insensibly three different Motions move?Which else to several sphears thou must ascribe,Moved contrarie with thwart obliquities,Or save the sun his labour, and that swift Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb supposed,Invisible else above all starrs, the WheeleOf Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe,If Earth industrious of her self fetch DayTravelling East, and with her part averseFrom the suns beam meet Night, her other partstill luminous by his ray. What if that lightsent from her through the wide transpicuous aire,To the terrestrial Moon be as a starrEnlightning her by Day, as she by Night This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there,Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seestAs Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produceFruits in her soft'nd soile, for some to eateAllotted there; and other suns perhapsWith thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrieCommunicating Male and Femal Light,Which two great sexes animate the World,stored in each Orb perhaps with some that live. For such vast room in Nature unpossest By living soule, desert and desolate,Onely to shine, yet scarce to contributeEach Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farrDown to this habitable, which returnesLight back to them, is obvious to dispute. But whether thus these things, or whether not,Whether the sun predominant in heavenRise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the sun,Hee from the East his flaming rode begin,Or shee from West her silent course advance With inoffensive pace that spinning sleepsOn her soft Axle, while she paces Eev'n,And be•…rs thee soft with the smooth Air along,sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid,Leave them to God above, him serve and feare;Of other Creatures, as him pleases best,Wherever plac't, let him dispose: joy thouIn what he gives to thee, this ParadiseAnd thy faire Eve; heaven is for thee too highTo know what passes there; be lowlie wise: Think onely what concernes thee and thy being;Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures thereLive, in what state, condition or degree,Contented that thus farr hath been revealedNot of Earth onely but of highest heaven. To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, replied. How fully hast thou satisfied mee, pureIntelligence of heaven, Angel serene,And freed from intricacies, taught to live, The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughtsTo interrupt the sweet of Life, from whichGod hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares,And not molest us, unless we our selvesseek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine. But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roaveUncheckt, and of her roaving is no end;Till warned, or by experience taught, she learne,That not to know at large of things remoteFrom use, obscure and suttle, but to know That which before us lies in daily life,Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume,Or emptiness, or fond impertinence,And renders us in things that most concerneUnpractised, unprepared, and still to seek. Therefore from this high pitch let us descendA lower flight, and speak of things at handUseful, whence haply mention may ariseOf somthing not unseasonable to askBy sufferance, and thy wonted favour deigned. Thee I have heard relating what was donEre my remembrance: now hear mee relateMy storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard;And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seestHow suttly to detaine thee I devise,Inviting thee to hear while I relate,Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply:For while I sit with thee, I seem in heaven,And sweeter thy discourse is to my eareThen Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirstAnd hunger both, from labour, at the houre Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace DivineImbued, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek. Nor are thy lips ungraceful, sire of men,Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on theeAbundantly his gifts hath also pouredInward and outward both, his image faire:speaking or mute all comliness and graceAttends thee, and each word, each motion formes. Nor less think wee in heaven of thee on EarthThen of our fellow servant, and inquireGladly into the wayes of God with Man:For God we see hath honoured thee, and set▪
        On Man his equal Love: say therefore on;For I that Day was absent, as befell,Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell;squared in full Legion (such command we had)To see that none thence issued forth a spie, Or enemie, while God was in his work,Least hee incenst at such eruption bold,Destruction with Creation might have mixt. Not that they durst without his leave attempt,But us he sends upon his high behestsFor state, as sovran King, and to enureOur prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shutThe dismal Gates, and barricadoed strong;But long ere our approaching heard withinNoise, other then the sound of Dance or song, Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage. Glad we returned up to the coasts of LightEre sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge. But thy relation now; for I attend,Pleased with thywords no less then thou with mine. so spake the Godlike Power, and thus our sire. For Man to tell how human Life beganIs hard; for who himself beginning knew?Desire with thee still longer to converseInduced me. As new wak't from soundest sleep soft on the flourie herb I found me laidIn Balmie sweat, which with his Beames the sunsoon dried, and on the reaking moisture fed. strait toward heaven my wondring Eyes I turnd,And gazed a while the ample skie, till raisedBy quick instinctive motion up I sprung,As thitherward endevoring, and uprightstood on my feet; about me round I sawHill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines,And liquid Lapse of murmuring streams; by these, Creatures that livd, and movd, and walked, or flew,Birds on the branches warbling; all things smiled,With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflowed. My self▪ I then perused, and Limb by Limbsurveied, and sometimes went, and sometimes ranWith supple joints, as lively vigour led:But who I was, or where, or from what cause,Knew not; to speak I tried, and forthwith spake,My Tongue obeied and readily could nameWhat e're I saw. Thou sun, said I, faire Light, And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay,Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?Not of my self; by some great Maker then,In goodness and in power praeeminent;Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,From whom I have that thus I move and live,And feel that I am happier then I know. While thus I called, and straied I knew not whither, From where I first drew Aire, and first beheldThis happie Light, when answer none returned,On a green shadie Bank profuse of FloursPensive I sate me down; there gentle sleepFirst found me, and with soft oppression seisedMy droused sense, untroubled, though I thoughtI the•… was passing to my former stateInsensible, and forthwith to dissolve:When suddenly stood at my Head a dream,Whose inward apparition gently moved My Fancy to believe I yet had being,And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise,First Man, of Men innumerable ordainedFirst Father, called by thee I come thy GuideTo the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepared. so saying, by the hand he took me raised,And over Fields and Waters, as in Airesmooth sliding without step, last led me upA woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, A Circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest TreesPlanted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I sawOf Earth before scarse pleasant seemd. Each TreeLoad'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the EyeTempting, stirred in me sudden appetiteTo pluck and eate; whereat I waked, and foundBefore mine Eyes all real, as the dreamHad lively shadowd: Here had new begunMy wandring, had not hee who was my GuideUp hither, from among the Trees appeered, Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with awIn adoration at his feet I fellsubmiss: he reared me, & Whom thou soughtst I am,said mildely, Author of all this thou seestAbove, or round about thee or beneath.

Not onely these fair bounds, but all the EarthTo thee and to thy Race I give; as LordsPossess it, and all things that therein live,Or live in sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle. In signe whereof cach Bird and Beast beholdAfter thir kindes; I bring them to receave From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtieWith low subjection; understand the sameOf Fish within thir watry residence,Not hither summond, since they cannot changeThir Element to draw the thinner Aire. As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast beholdApproaching two and two, These cowring lowWith blandishment, each Bird stooped on his wing. I named them, as they passed, and understoodThir Nature, with such knowledg God endued My sudden apprehension: but in theseI found not what me thought I wanted still;And to the heavenly vision thus presumed. O by what Name, for thou above all these,Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,surpassest farr my naming, how may IAdore thee, Author of this Universe,And all this good to man, for whose well beingso amply, and with hands so liberalThou hast provided all things: but with mee I see not who partakes. In solitudeWhat happiness, who can enjoy alone,Or all enjoying, what contentment find?Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,As with a smile more bright'nd, thus replied. What call'st thou solitude, is not the EarthWith various living creatures, and the AireReplenisht, and all these at thy commandTo come and play before thee, know'st thou notThir language and thir wayes, they also know, And reason not contemptibly; with theseFind pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. so spake the Universal Lord, and seemedso ordering. I with leave of speech implored,And humble deprecation thus replied. Let not my words offend thee, heavenly Power,My Maker, be propitious while I speak. Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,And these inferiour farr beneath me set?Among unequals what societie Can sort, what harmonie or true delight?Which must be mutual, in proportion dueGiv'n and received; but in disparitieThe one intense, the other still •…emissCannot well suite with either, but soon proveTedious alike: Of fellowship I speaksuch as I seek, fit to participateAll rational delight, wherein the bruteCannot be human consort; they rejoyceEach with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; so fitly them in pairs thou hast combined;Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowleso well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all. Whereto 〈◊〉 Almighty answered, not displeased. A nice and suttle happiness I seeThou to thy self proposest, in the choiceOf thy Associates, Adam, and wilt tasteNo pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie. What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my state, seem I to thee sufficiently possestOf happiness, or not? who am aloneFrom all Eternitie, for none I knowsecond to mee or like, equal much less. How have I then with whom to hold conversesave with the Creatures which I made, and thoseTo me inferiour, infinite descentsBeneath what other Creatures are to thee?He ceased, I lowly answered. To attaineThe highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes All human thoughts come short, supream of things;Thou in thy self art perfet, and in theeIs no deficience found; not so is Man,But in degree, the cause of his desireBy conversation with his like to help,Or solace his defects. No need that thoushouldst propagat, already infinite;And through all numbers absolute, though One;B•…t Man by number is to manifestHis single imperfection, and beget Like of his like, his Image multiplied,In unitie defective, which requiresCollateral love, and deerest amitie. Thou in thy secresie although alone,Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st notsocial communication, yet so pleased,Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wiltOf Union or Communion, deified;I by conversing cannot these erectFrom prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom usedPermissive, and acceptance found, which gainedThis answer from the gratious voice Divine. Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleased,And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone,Which thou hast rightly named, but of thy self,Expressing well the spirit within thee free,My Image, not imparted to the Brute,Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for theeGood reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st,Knew it not good for Man to be alone,And no such companie as then thou saw'stIntended thee, for trial onely brought,To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet:What next I bring shall please thee, be assured,Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire. Hee ended, or I heard no more, for nowMy earthly by his heavenly overpowerd, Which it had long stood under, streind to the highthIn that celestial Colloquie sublime,As with an object that excels the sense,Dazled and spent, sunk down, and sought repairOf sleep, which instantly fell on me, calledBy Nature as in aide, and closed mine eyes.

        To find her, or for ever to deploreHer loss, and other pleasures all abjure:When out of hope, behold her, not farr off;such as I saw her in my dream, adorndWith what all Earth or Heaven could bestow To make her amiable: On she came,Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen,And guided by his voice, nor uninformdOf nuptial sanctitie and marriage Rites:Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her Eye,In every gesture dignitie and love. I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilledThy words, Creator bounteous and benigne,Giver of all things faire, but fairest this Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now seeBone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my selfBefore me; Woman is her Name, of ManExtracted; for this cause he shall forgoe,Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere;And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one soule. she heard me thus, and though divinely brought,Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie,Her vertue and the conscience of her worth,That would be wooed, and not unsought be won, Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retired,The more desirable, or to say all,Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought,Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turned;I followed her, she what was Honour knew,And with obsequious Majestie approvedMy pleaded reason. To the Nuptial BowreI led her blushing like the Morn: all heaven,And happie Constellations on that houreshed thir selectest influence; the Earth Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill;Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle AiresWhispered it to the Woods, and from thir wingsFlung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie shrub,Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Nightsung spousal, and bid haste the Eevning starrOn his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp.

And Eve first to her Husband thus began. Adam, well may we labour still to dressThis Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour. Our pleasant task enjoyned, but till more handsAid us, the work under our labour grows,Luxurious by restraint; what we by dayLop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, One night or two with wanton growth deridesTending to wilde.

To whom mild answer Adam thus returned. sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyondCompare above all living Creatures deare,Well hast thou motioned, wel thy thoughts imploydHow we might best fulfill the work which here God hath assigned us, nor of me shalt passUnpraised: for nothing lovelier can be foundIn woman, then to studie houshold good,And good workes in her Husband to promote.

The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve, 
        As one who loves, and some unkindn•…ss m•…ets,With sweet austeèr composure thus replied. Ofspring of heaven and Earth, and all Earths Lord,That such an Enemie we have, who seeksOur ruin, both by thee informd I learne,And from the parting Angel over-heardAs in a shadie nook I stood behind,Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. But that thou shouldst my firmness therfore doubtTo God or thee, because we have a foe May tempt it, I expected not to hear. His violence thou fearst not, being such,As wee, not capable of death or paine,Can either not receave, or can repell. His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrsThy equal fear that my firm Faith and LoveCan by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't;Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy brest,Adam, missthought of her to thee so dear?To whom with healing words Adam replied. Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve,
        For such thou art, from sin and blame entire:Not diffident of thee do I dissuadeThy absence from my sight, but to avoidTh' attempt it self, intended by our Foe. For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least aspersesThe tempted with dishonour foul, supposedNot incorruptible of Faith, not prooffAgainst temptation: thou thy self with scorneAnd anger wouldst resent the offered wrong, Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,If such affront I labour to avertFrom thee alone, which on us both at onceThe Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare;Or daring, first on •…eeth' assault shall light.

Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feelWhen I am present, and thy trial chooseWith me, best witness of thy Vertue tried. so spake domestick Adam in his careAnd Matrimonial Love, but Eve, who thoughtLess attributed to her Faith sincere, Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd.

Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes,That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.

        Persisted, yet submiss, though last, replied. With thy permission then, and thus forewarndChiefly by what thy own last reasoning wordsTouchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, May finde us both perhaps farr less prepared,The willinger I goe, nor much expectA Foe so proud will first the weaker seek;so bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her handsoft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph lightOread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine,Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's selfIn gate surpassed and Goddess-like deport,Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, But with such Gardning Tools as Art yet rude,Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought.

For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,Meer serpent in appearance, forth was come,And on his Quest, where likeliest he might findeThe onely two of Mankinde, but in themThe whole included Race, his purposd prey. In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuftOf Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,Thir tendance or Plantation for delight,By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet He sought them both, but wished his hap might findEve separate, he wished, but not with hopeOf what so seldom chanced, when to his wish,Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,Half spied, so thick the Roses bushing roundAbout her glowd, oft stooping to supportEach Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gayCarnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour,From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. Neerer he drew, and many a walk traversedOf stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme,Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seenAmong thick-wov'n Arborets and FloursImborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve:

Thoughts, whither have ye led me, with what sweetCompulsion thus transported to forgetWhat hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hopeOf Paradise for Hell, hope here to tasteOf pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,save what is in destroying, other joyTo me is lost. Then let me not let passOccasion which now smiles, behold alone The Woman, opportune to all attempts,Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,Whose higher intellectual more I shun,And strength, of courage hautie, and of limbHeroic built, though of terrestrial mould,Foe not informidable, exempt from wound,I not; so much hath Hell debased, and paineInfeebled me, to what I was in heaven. shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods,Not terrible, though terrour be in Love And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate,Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feigned,The way which to her ruin now I tend. so spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclosedIn serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve

As when a ship by skilful stearsman wroughtNigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the WindVeres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her saile;so varied hee, and of his tortuous TraineCurld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,

What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc'tBy Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?The first at lest of these I thought deniedTo Beasts, whom God on thir Creation-DayCreated mute to all articulat sound;The latter I demurre, for in thir looksMuch reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.

To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied. Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve,
        Easie to mee it is to tell thee allWhat thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: I was at first as other Beasts that grazeThe trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,As was my food, nor aught but food discernedOr sex, and apprehended nothing high:Till on a day roaving the field, I chancedA goodly Tree farr distant to beholdLoaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n,Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the TeatsOf Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.

To whom the Tempter guilefully replied. Indeed? hath God then said that of the FruitOf all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate,Yet Lords declared of all in Earth or Aire?To whom thus Eve yet sinless.

Queen of this Universe, doe not believeThose rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you LifeTo Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee,Mee who have touched and tasted, yet both live,And life more perfet have attaind then FateMeant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. shall that be shut to Man, which to the BeastIs open? or will God incense his ireFor such a petty Trespass, and not praiseRather your dauntless vertue, whom the painOf Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be,Deterrd not from atchieving what might leadeTo happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evilBe real, why not known, since easier shunnd?God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid:Your feare it self of Death removes the feare.

Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admired,Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assayGave elocution to the mute, and taughtThe Tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise:Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, Conceales not from us, naming thee the TreeOf Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;Forbids us then to taste, but his forbiddingCommends thee more, w•…ile it inf•…s the goodBy thee communicated, and our want:For good unknown, sure is not had, or hadAnd yet unknown, is as not had at all.

Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay?Thee I have misst, and thought it long, deprivedThy presence, agonie of love till nowNot felt, nor shall be twice, for never moreMean I to trie, what rash untried I sought, The paine of absence from thy sight. But strangeHath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:This Tree is not as we are told, a TreeOf danger tasted, nor to evil unknownOp'ning the way, but of Divine effectTo open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;And hath bin tasted such: the serpent wise,Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,Not dead, as we are threatned, but thenceforth Endued with human voice and human sense,Reasoning to admiration, and with meePerswasively hath so prevaild, that IHave also tasted, and have also foundTh' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,Dimm erst, dilated spirits, ampler Heart,And growing up to Godhead; which for theeChiefly I▪ sought, without thee can despise. For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon. Thou therfore also taste, that equal LotMay joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;Least thou not tasting, different degreeDisjoyne us, and I then too late renounceDeitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told;But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heardThe fatal Trespass don by Eve, amazed,Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill Ran through his v•…ins, and all his joynts relaxed;From his slack hand the Garland wreathed for Eve
        Down droped, and all the faded Roses shed:speechless he stood and pale, till thus at lengthFirst to himself he inward silence broke. O fairest of Creation, last and bestOf all Gods Works, Creature in whom excelledWhatever can to sight or thought be formd,Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote?Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgressThe strict forbiddance, how to violateThe sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraudOf Enemie hath beguiled thee, yet unknown,And mee with thee hath ruind, for with theeCertain my resolution is to Die;How can I live without thee, how forgoeThy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyned,To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? should God create another Eve, and IAnother Rib afford, yet loss of theeWould never from my heart; no no, I feelThe Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy stateMine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. so having said, as one from sad dismayRecomforted, and after thoughts disturbdsubmitting to what seemd remediless,Thus in calme mood his Words to Eve he turnd.

For still they knew, and ought to have still rememberedThe high Injunction not to taste that Fruit,Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,Incurred, what could they less, the penaltie,And manifold in sin, deserved to fall. Up into heaven from Paradise in hastTh' Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sadFor Man, for of his state by this they knew,Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln Entrance unseen. soon as th' unwelcome newsFrom Earth arrived at Heaven Gate, displeasedAll were who heard, dim sadness did not spareThat time Celestial visages, yet mixtWith pitie, violated not thir bliss. About the new-arrived, in multitudesTh' ethereal People ran, to hear and knowHow all befell: they towards the Throne supreamAccountable made haste to make appearWith righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance, And easily approved; when the most HighEternal Father from his secret Cloud,Amidst in Thunder uttered thus his voice.

Justice shall not return as bountie scorned. But whom send I to judge them? whom but theeVicegerent son, to thee I have transferredAll Judgement, whether in heaven, or Earth, or Hell. Easie it may be seen that I intendMercie collegue with Justice, sending theeMans Friend, his Mediator, his designed Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie,And destined Man himself to judge Man fall'n. so spake the Father, and unfoulding brightToward the right hand his Glorie, on the sonBlazed forth unclouded Deitie; he fullResplendent all his Father manifestExpressed, and thus divinely answered milde.

Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged. Now was the sun in Western cadence lowFrom Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hourTo fan the Earth now waked, and usher inThe Eevning coole when he from wrauth more cooleCame the mild Judge and Intercessor bothTo sentence Man: the voice of God they heardNow walking in the Garden, by soft windesBrought to thir 〈◊〉, while day declined, they heard,And from his presence hid themselves among The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till GodApproaching, thus to Adam called aloud.

He came, and with him Eve, more loth, though firstTo offend, discount'nanc't both, and discomposed; Love was not in thir looks, either to GodOr to each other, but apparent guilt,And shame, and perturbation, and despaire,Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile. Whence Adam faultring long, thus answered brief. I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voiceAffraid, being naked, hid my self. To whomThe gracious Judge without revile replied. My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not feared,But still rejoyc't, how is it now become so dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, whoHath told thee? hast thou 〈◊〉 of the TreeWhereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?To whom thus Adam sore beset replied.

This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help,And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good,so fit, so acceptable, so Divine,That from her hand I could suspect no ill, And what she did, whatever in it self,Her doing seemed to justifie the deed;shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate. To whom the sovran Presence thus replied. Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obeyBefore his voice, or was shee made thy guide,superior, or but equal, that to herThou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the PlaceWherein God set thee above her made of thee,And for thee, whose perfection farr excelled Hers in all real dignitie Adorndshe was indeed, and lovely to attractThy Love, not thy subjection, and her GiftsWere such as under Government well seemed,Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy partAnd person, had'st thou known thy self aright. so having said, he thus to Eve in few:say Woman, what is this which thou hast done?To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelmed,Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge Bold or loquacious, thus 〈◊〉 replied. The serpent me beguiled and I did eate. Which when the Lord God heard, without delayTo Judgement he proceeded on th' accusedserpent though brute, unable to transferreThe Guilt on him who made him instrumentOf mischief, and polluted from the endOf his Creation; justly then accurst,As vitiated in Nature: more to knowConcerned not Man (since he no further knew) Nor altered his offence; yet God at lastTo satan •…irst in sin his doom applied,Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best:And on the serpent thus his curse let fall. Because thou hast done this, thou art accurstAbove all Cattel, each Beast of the Field;Upon thy Belly groveling thou sh•…lt goe,And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life. Between Thee and the Woman I will putEnmitie, and between thine and her seed; Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. so spake this 'Oracle, then verifiedWhen Jesus son of Mary second Eve,
        saw satan fall like Lightning down from heaven,Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Gravespoild Principalities and Powers, triumphtIn open shew, and with ascention brightCaptivity led captive through the A•…re,The Realme it self of satan long usurpt,Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise,And to the Woman thus his sentence turned. Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplieBy thy Conception; Childern thou shalt bringIn sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands willThine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced. Because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy Wife,And eaten of the Tree concerning whichI charged thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, Cursed is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrowshalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life;Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forthUnbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field,In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread,Till thou return unto the ground, for thouOut of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth,For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. so judged he Man, both Judge and saviour sent,And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day Removed farr off; then pittying how they stoodBefore him naked to the aire, that nowMust suffer change, disdained not to beginThenceforth the forme of servant to assume,As when he washed his servants feet, so nowAs Father of his Familie he cladThir nakedness with skins of Beasts, or slain,Or as the snake with youthful Coate repaid;And thought not much to cloath his Enemies:Nor hee thir outward onely with the skins Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much moreOpprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,Araying covered from his Fathers sight. To him with swift ascent he up returnd,Into his blissful bosom reassumedIn glory as of old, to him appeasedAll, though all-knowing, what had past with ManRecounted, mixing intercession sweet. Meanwhile ere thus was sined and judged on Earth,Within the Gates of Hell sate sin and Death, In counterview within the Gates, that nowstood open wide, belching outrageous flameFarr into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through,sin opening, who thus now to Death began.

It cannot beBut that success attends him; if mishap,Ere this he had returned, with fury driv'nBy his Avenger, since no place like thisCan fit his punishment, or their revenge.

        Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyned,And scourged with many a stroak th' indignant waves. Now had they brought the work by wondrous ArtPontifical, a ridge of pendent RockOver the vext Abyss, following the trackOf satan, to the self same place where heeFirst lighted from his Wing, and landed safeFrom out of Chaos to the outside bareOf this round World: with Pinns of AdamantAnd Chains they made all fast, too fast they made And durable; and now in little spaceThe Confines met of Empyrean heavenAnd of this World, and on the left hand HellWith long reach interposed; three sev'ral wayesIn sight, to each of these three places led.

Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreased. Long hee admiring stood, till sin, his faireInchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds,Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own,Thou art thir Author and prime Architect:For I no sooner in my Heart divined,My Heart, which by a secret harmoniestill moves with thine, joyned in connexion sweet,That thou on Earth hadst prospered, which thy looks Now also evidence, but straight I feltThough distant from thee Worlds between, yet feltThat I must a•…ter thee with this thy son;such fatal consequence unites us three:Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds,Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscureDetain from following thy illustrious track. Thou hast atchieved our libertie, confinedWithin Hell Gates till now, thou us impowerdTo fortifie thus farr, and overlay With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath wonWhat thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gainedWith odds what Warr hath lost, and fully avengedOur foile in heaven; here thou shalt Monarch reign,There didst not; there let him still Victor sway,As Battel hath adjudged, from this new WorldRetiring, by his own doom alienated,And henceforth Monarchie with thee divideOf all things, parted by th' Empyreal bounds, His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World,Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne. Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad.

O fleeting joyesOf Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes!Did I request thee, Maker, from my ClayTo mould me Man, did I sollicite theeFrom darkness to promote me, or here placeIn this delicious Garden? as my WillConcurd not to my being, it were but rightAnd equal to reduce me to my dust,Desirous to resigne, and render backAll I receaved, unable to performe Thy terms too hard, by which I was to holdThe good I sought not. To the loss of that,sufficient penaltie, why hast thou addedThe sense of endless woes? inexplicableThy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late,I thus contest; then should have been refusdThose terms whatever, when they were proposed:Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,Then cavil the conditions? and though GodMade thee without thy leave, what if thy son Prove disobedient, and reproved, retort,Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not:Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of theeThat proud excuse? yet him not thy election,But Natural necessity begot. God made thee of choice his own, and of his ownTo serve him, thy reward was of his grace,Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: O welcom hour whenever! why delayesHis hand to execute what his DecreeFixd on this day? why do I overlive,Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd outTo deathless pain? how gladly would I meetMortalitie my sentence, and be EarthInsensible, how glad would lay me downAs in my Mothers lap? there I should restAnd sleep secure; his dreadful voice no moreWould Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse To mee and to my ofspring would torment meWith cruel expectation. Yet one doubtPursues me still, least all I cannot die,Least that pure breath of Life, the spirit of ManWhich God inspired, cannot together perishWith this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,Or in some other dismal place, who knowsBut I shall die a living Death? O thoughtHorrid, if true! yet why? it was but breathOf Life that sinned; what dies but what had life And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. All of me then shall die: let this appeaseThe doubt, since humane reach no further knows. For though the Lord of all be infinite,Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,But mortal doomed. How can he exerciseWrath without end on Man whom Death must end?Can he make deathless Death? that were to makestrange contradiction, which to God himselfImpossible is held, as Argument Of weakness, not of Power.

If PrayersCould alter high Decrees, I to that placeWould speed before thee, and be louder heard,That on my head all might be visited,Thy frailtie and infirmer sex forgiv'n,To me committed and by me exposed. But rise, let us no more contend, nor blameEach other, blamed enough elsewhere, but striveIn offices of Love, how we may light'n Each others burden in our share of woe;since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see,Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill,A long days dying to augment our paine,And to our seed (O hapless seed!) derived. To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied. Adam, by sad experiment I knowHow little weight my words with thee can finde,Found so erroneous, thence by just eventFound so unfortunate; nevertheless, Restored by thee, vile as I am, to placeOf new acceptance, hopeful to regaineThy Love, the sole contentment of my heart,Living or dying from thee I will not hideWhat thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n,Tending to 〈◊〉 relief of our extremes,Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,As in our evils, and of easier choice.

But if thou judge it hard and difficult,Conversing, looking, loving, to abstainFrom Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet,And with desire to languish without hope,Before the present object languishingWith like desire, which would be miserieAnd torment less then none of what we dread,Then both our 〈◊〉 and seed at once to freeFrom what we fear for both, let us make short, Let us •…eek Death, or hee not found, supplyWith our own hands his Office on our selves;Why stand we longer shivering under •…eares,That shew no end but Death, and have the power,Of many wayes to die the 〈◊〉 choosing,Destruction with destruction to destroy. she ended heer, or vehement despaireBroke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughtsHad entertaind, as died her Cheeks with pale. But Adam with such counsel nothing swaied, To better hopes his more attentive mindeLabouring had raised, and thus to Eve replied. Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seemsTo argue in thee somthing more sublimeAnd excellent then what thy minde contemnes;But self-destruction therefore saught, refutesThat excellence thought in thee, and implies,Not thy contempt, but anguish and regretFor loss of life and pleasure overloved.

I at first with two fair giftsCreated him endowd, with HappinessAnd Immortalitie: that fondly lost,This other served but to eternize woe; Till I provided Death; so Death becomesHis final remedie, and after LifeTried in sharp tribulation, and refinedBy Faith and faithful works, to second Life,Wak't in the renovation of the just,Resignes him up with heaven and Earth renewd. But let us call to synod all the BlestThrough heavens wide bounds; from them I will not hideMy judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,As how with peccant Angels late they saw; And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd. He ended, and the son gave signal highTo the bright Minister that watchd, hee blewHis Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhapsWhen God descended, and perhaps once moreTo sound at general doom. Th' Angelic blastFilld all the Regions: from thir blissful BowrsOf Amarantin shade, Fountain or spring,By the waters of Life, where ere they sateIn fellowships of joy: the sons of Light Hasted, resorting to the summons high,And took thir seats; till from his Throne supreamTh' Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will. O sons, like one of us Man is becomeTo know both Good and Evil, since his tasteOf that defended Fruit; but let him boastHis knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,Happier, had it sufficed him to have knownGood by it self, and Evil not at all. He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite, My motions in him, longer then they move,His heart I know, how variable and vainself-left. Least therefore his now bolder handReach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,And live for ever, dream at least to liveFor ever, to remove him I decree,And send him from the Garden forth to TillThe Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile. Michael, this my behest have thou in charge,Take to thee from among the Cherubim Thy choice of flaming warriours, least the FiendOr in behalf of Man, or to invadeVacant possession som new trouble raise:Hast thee, and from the Paradise of GodWithout remorse drive out the sinful Pair,From hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounceTo them and to thir Progenie from thencePerpetual bani•…ent. Yet least they faintAt the sad sentence rigorously urged,For I behold the•… so•…nd and with tears Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide. If patiently thy bidding they obey,Dismiss them not disconsolate; revealeTo Adam what shall come in future dayes,As I shall thee enlighten, intermixMy Cov'nant in the Womans seed renewd;so send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:And on the East side of the Garden place,Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes,Cherubic watch, and of a sword the flame Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:Least Paradise a receptacle proveTo spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude. He ceased; and th' Archangelic Power preparedFor swist descent, with him the Cohort brightOf watchful Cherubim; four faces eachHad, like a double Janus, all thir shapespangled with eyes more numerous then those Of Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze,Charmed with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral ReedOf Hermes, or his opiate Rod.

Adam observed, and with his Eye the chasePursuing, not unmoved to Eve thus spake. O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh,Which heaven by these mute signs in Nature shewsForerunners of his purpose, or to warnUs haply too secure of our dischargeFrom penaltie, because from death releasts•…e days; how long, and what till then our life,Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,And thither must return and be no more.

He erred not, for by this the heavenly BandsDown from a skie of Jasper lighted nowIn Paradise, and on a Hill made alt, A glorious Apparition, had not doubtAnd carnal fear that day dimmed Adams eye. Not that more glorious, when the Angels metJacob in Mahanaim, where he sawThe sield Pavilioned with his Guardians bright;Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerdIn Dothan, covered with a Camp of Fire,Against the s•…rian King, who to surprizeOne man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,Warr unproclamed. The Princely Hierarch In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seisePossession of the Gard•…n; hee alone,To finde where Adam shelterd, took his way,Not unperceaved of Adam, who to Eve,
        While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhapsOf us will soon determin, or imposeNew Laws to be observed; f•…r I descrieFrom yonder blazing Cloud •…hat veils the HillOne of the heavenly Host, and by his Gate None of the meanest, some great PotentateOr of the Thrones above, such MajestieInvests him coming; yet not terrible,That I should fear, nor sociably mild,As Raphael, that I should much confide,But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,Not in his shape Celestial, but as ManClad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes A militarie Vest of purple flowdLivelier then Meliboean, or the graineOf sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's oldIn time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff;His starrie Helme unbuckled shewed him primeIn Manhood where Youth ended; by his sideAs in a glistering Zodiac hung the sword,satans dire dread, and in his hand the spear. Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his stateInclined not, but his coming thus declared. Adam, heavens high behest no Preface needs:sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,Defeated of his seisure many dayesGiv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent,And one bad act with many deeds well doneMayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeasedRedeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claime;But longer in this Paradise to dwellPermits not; to remove thee I am come, And send thee from the Garden forth to tillThe ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter soile. He added not, for Adam at the newesHeart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseenYet all had heard, with audible lamentDiscovered soon the place of her retire. O unexspected stroke, worse then of Death!Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leaveThee Native soile, these happie Walks and shades, Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,Quiet though sad, the respit of that dayThat must be mortal to us both. O flours,That never will in other Climate grow,My early visitation, and my lastAt Eev'n, which I bred up with tender handFrom the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names,Who now shall reare ye to the sun, or rankeYour Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount?Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd With what to sight or smell was sweet; from theeHow shall I part, and whither wander downInto a lower World, to this obscureAnd wilde, how shall we breath in other AireLess pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. Lament not Eve, but patiently resigneWhat justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,Thus over fond, on that which is not thine;Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;Where he abides, think there thy native soile. Adam by this from the cold sudden dampRecovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,To Michael thus his humble words addressd. Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or namedOf them the Highest, for such of shape may seemPrince above Princes, gently hast thou touldThy message, which might else in telling wound,And in performing end us; what besides Of sorrow and dejection and despairOur frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,Departure from this happy place, our sweetRecess, and onely consolation leftFamiliar to our eyes, all places elseIn hospitable appeer and desolate,Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayerIncessant I could hope to change the willOf him who all things can, I would not ceaseTo wearie him with my assiduous cries: But prayer against his absolute DecreeNo more availes then breath against the winde,Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:Therefore to his great bidding I submit. This most a•…icts •…e, that departing hence,As from his face I shall be hid, deprivdHis blessed count'nance; here I could frequent,With worship, place by place where he voutsafedPresence Divine, and to my sons relate;On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree stood visible, among these Pines his voiceI heard, here with him at this Fountain talked:so many grateful Altars I would reareOf grassie Terfe, and pile up every stoneOf lustre from the brook, in memorie,Or monument to Ages, and thereonOffer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours:In yonder nether World where shall I seekHis bright appearances, or footstep trace?For though I fled him angrie, yet recalled To life prolongd and promisd Race, I nowGladly behold though but his utmost skirtsOf glory, and farr off his steps adore. To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. Adam, thou know'st heaven his, and all the Earth▪

Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first beholdTh' effects which thy original crime hath wroughtIn some to spring from thee, who never touchedTh' excepted Tree, nor with the snake conspired,Nor sinned thy sin, yet from that sin deriveCorruption to bring forth more violent deeds. His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field,Part arable and tilth, whereon were sheaves New reapt, the other part sheep walks and foulds;Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stoodRustic, of grassie sord; thither anonA sweatie Reaper from his Tillage broughtFirst Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow sheaf,Unculled, as came to hand; a shepherd nextMore 〈◊〉 came with the Firstlings of his FlockChoicest and best; then sacrificing, laidThe Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strewed,On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites performed. His Offring soon propitious Fire from heavenConsumed with nimble glance, and grateful steame;The others not, for his was not sincere;Whereat hee inlie raged, and as they talked,smote him into the Midriff with a stoneThat beat out life; he fell, and deadly paleGroand out his soul with gushing bloud effused. Much at that sight was Adam in his heartDismaied, and thus in haste to th' Angel cried. O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n To that meek man, who well had sacrificed;Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?T' whom Michael thus, hee also moved, replied. These two are Brethren, Adam, and to comeOut of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain,For envie that his Brothers Offering •…oundFrom heaven acceptance; but the bloodie FactWill be avenged, and th' others Faith approvedLoose no reward, though here thou see him die,Rowling in dust and gore. To which our sire. Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!But have I now seen Death? Is this the wayI must return to native dust? O sightOf terrour, foul and ugly to behold,Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!To whom thus M•…l. Death thou hast seenIn his •…irst shape on man; •…ut many shapesOf Death, and many are the wayes that leadTo his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to senseM•…re terrible at th' entrance then within. so•…e, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die,By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance moreIn Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bringDiseases dire, of which a monstrous crewBefore thee shall appear; that thou mayst knowWhat miserie th' inabstinence of Eve
        shall bring on men. Immediately a placeBefore his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laidNumbers of all diseased, all maladies Of gastly spasm, or racking torture, qualmesOf heart-fick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,Convulsions, Epilepsies, 〈◊〉 Catarrhs,Intestin stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,Dropsies, and 〈◊〉, and Joint-racking Rheums. Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despairTended the sick 〈◊◊〉 Couch to Couch;And over them triumphant Death his Dartshook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok'tWith vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. sight so deform what heart of Rock could longDrie-eied behold? Adam could not, but wept,Though not of Woman born, compassion quelledHis best of Man, and gave him up to tearsA space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,And scarce recovering words his plaint renewed. O miserable Mankind, to what fallDegraded, to what wretched state reserved!Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'nTo be thus wrested from us? rather why Obtruded on us thus? who if we knewWhat we receive, would ei•…her not acceptLife offered, or soon beg to lay it down,Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thusTh' Image of God in man created onceso goodly and erect, though faultie since,To such unsightly sufferings be debas't〈◊〉 inhuman pains? Why should not Man,R•…taining still Divine similitudeIn part, from such deformities be free, And for his Makers Image sake exempt?Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, thenForsook them, when themselves they villifiedTo serve ungoverned appetite, and tookHis Image whom they served, a 〈◊〉 vice,Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. 
        Therefore so abject is thir punishment,Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,Or if his likeness, by themselves 〈◊〉
        While they pervert 〈◊〉 Natures healthful rules To loathsom sickness, worthily, since theyGods Image did not reverence in themselves. I yeild it just, said Adam, and submit. But is there yet no other way, 〈◊〉
        These painful passages, how we may comeTo Death, and mix with our 〈◊〉 dust?There is, said Michael, if thou well observeThe rule of not too much, by temperance taughtIn what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thenceDue nourishment, not gluttonous delight, Till many years over thy head return:so maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou dropInto thy Mothers lap, or be with easeGatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:This is old age; but then thou must outliveThy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will changeTo witherd weak & gray; thy senses thenO•…se, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youthHopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne A melancholly damp of cold and dryTo waigh thy spirits down, and last consumeThe Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolongLife much, bent rather how I may be quitFairest and easiest of this combrous charge,Which I must keep till my appointed dayOf rendring up. Michael to him replied. Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livstLive well, how long or short permit to heaven: And now prepare thee for another sight. He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereonWere Tents of various hue; by some were herdsOf Cattel grazing: others, whence the soundOf Instruments that made melodious chimeWas heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovdThir stops and chords was feen: his volant touchInstinct through all proportions low and highFled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue. In other part stood one who at the Forge Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and BrassHad melted (whether found where casual fireHad wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hotTo som Caves mouth, or whether washt by streamFrom underground) the liquid Ore he dreindInto fit moulds prepared; from which he formdFirst his own Tooles; then, what might else be wroughtFusil or grav'n in mettle. After these,But on the hether side a different sort From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir seat,Down to the Plain descended: by thir guiseJust men they seemd, and all thir study bentTo worship God aright, and know his worksNot •…id, nor those things lost which might preserveFreedom and Peace to men: they on the PlainLong had not walkt, when from the Tents beholdA Beavie of fair Women, richly gayIn Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sungsoft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: The Men though grave, eied them, and let thir eyesRove without rein, till in the amorous NetFast caught, they liked, and each his liking chose;And now of love they treat till th' Eevning starLoves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heatThey light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invokeHymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't;With Feast and Musick all the Ten•…si resound. such happy interview and fair eventOf love & youth not lost, songs, Garlands, Flours, And charming symphonies attached the heartOf Adam, soon enclined to admit delight,The bent of Nature; which he thus expressed. True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,Much better seems this Vision, and more hopeOf peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse,Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is bestBy pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, Created, as thou art, to nobler endHolie and pure, conformitie divine. Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the TentsOf wickedness, wherein shall dwell his RaceWho slew his Brother; studious they appereOf Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,Unmindful of thir Maker, though his spiritTaught them, but they his gifts acknowledged none. Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,Yet empty of all good wherein consistsWomans domestic honour and chief praise;Bred onely and completed to the tasteOf lustful appetence, to sing, to dance,To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. To these that sober Race of Men, whose livesReligious titled them the sons of God,shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fameIgnobly, to the traines and to the smiles Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,(Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for whichThe world erelong a world of tears must weepe. To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. O pittie and shame, that they who to live wellEnterd so faire, should turn aside to treadPaths indirect, or in the mid way faint!But still I see the tenor of Mans woeHolds on the same, from Woman to begin. From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, said th' Angel, who should better hold his placeBy wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. But now prepare thee for another scene. He lookd and saw wide Territorie spredBefore him, Towns, and rural works between,Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming steed,single or in Array of Battel ranged Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;One way a Band select from forage drivesA herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire KineFrom a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the shepherds flye,But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray;With cruel Tournament the squadrons joine;Where Cattel pastured late, now scatterd liesWith Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field Deserted: Others to a Citie strongLay siege, encampt; by Batterie, scale, and Mine,Assaulting; others from the Wall defendWith Dart and Jav'lin, stones and sulfurous Fire;On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. In other part the sceptered Haralds callTo Council in the Citie Gates: anonGrey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soonIn factious opposition, till at last Of middle Age one rising, eminentIn wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,And Judgement from above: him old and youngExploded, and had seized with violent hands,Had not a Cloud descending snatched him thenceUnseen amid the throng: so violenceProceeded, and Oppression, and sword-LawThrough all the Plain, and refuge none was found. Adam was all in tears, and to his guide Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal DeathInhumanly to men, and multiplyTen thousand fould the sin of him who slewHis Brother; for of whom such massacherMake they but of thir Brethren, men of men?But who was that Just Man, whom had not heavenRescued, had in his Righteousness bin lost?To whom thus Michael; These are the productOf those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st; Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselvesAbhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. such were these Giants, men of high renown;For in those dayes Might onely shall be admired,And Valour and Heroic Vertu called;To overcome in Battel, and subdueNations, and bring home spoils with infiniteMan-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitchOf human Glorie, and for Glorie done Of triumph, to be styled great Conquerours,Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and sons of Gods,Destroyers rightlier called and Plagues of men. Thus Fame shall be achieved, renown on Earth,And what most merits fame in silence hid. But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldstThe onely righteous in a World perverse,And therefore hated, therefore so besetWith Foes for daring single to be just,And utter odious Truth, that God would come To judge them with his saints: Him the most HighRapt in a balmie Cloud with winged steeds▪
        Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with GodHigh in salvation and the Climes of bliss,Exempt from Death; to shew thee what rewardAwaits the good, the rest what punishment;Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. He looked, & saw the sace of things quite changed▪
        The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,All now was turned to jollitie and game, To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,Marrying or prostituting, as befell,Rape or Adulterie, where passing faireAllurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. At length a Reverend sire among them came,And of thir▪ doings great dislike declared,And testified against thir wayes; hee oftFrequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachdConversion and Repentance, as to souls In prison under Judgements imminent:But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceasedContending, and removed his Tents farr off;Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,Measured by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth,smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a doreContrived, and of provisions laid in largeFor Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taughtThir order; last the sire, and his three sonsWith thir four Wives; and God made fast the dore. Meanwhile the southwind rose, & with black wingsWide hovering, all the Clouds together droveFrom under heaven; the Hills to their supplieVapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,sent up amain; and now the thick'nd skieLike a dark Ceeling stood; down rushed the RainImpetuous, and continued till the Earth No more was seen; the floating Vessel swumUplifted; and secure with beaked prowRode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings elseFlood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pompDeep under water rould; sea covered sea,sea without shoar; and in thir PalacesWhere luxurie late reigned, sea-monsters whelpedAnd stabled; of Mankind, so numerous late,All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't. How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,Depopulation; thee another Floud,Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drowned,And sunk thee as thy sons; till gently reardBy th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,Though comfortless, as when a Father mournsHis Childern, all in view destroyd at once;And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. O Visions ill foreseen! better had ILived ignorant of future, so had borne My part of evil onely, each dayes lotAnough to bear; those now, that were dispenstThe burd'n of many Ages, on me lightAt once, by my foreknowledge gaining BirthAbortive, to torment me ere thir being,With thought that they must be. Let no man seekHenceforth to be foretold what shall befallHim or his Childern, evil he may be sure,Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,And hee the future evil shall no less In apprehension then in substance feelGrievous to bear: but that care now is past,Man is not whom to warne: those few escap'tFamin and anguish will at last consumeWandring that watrie Desert: I had hopeWhen violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth,All would have then gon well, peace would have crowndWith length of happy days the race of man;But I was farr deceaved; for now I seePeace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,And whether here the Race of man will end. To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawstIn triumph and luxurious wealth, are theyFirst seen in acts of prowess eminentAnd great exploits, but of true vertu void;Who having spilt much blood, and don much wastesubduing Nations, and achievd therebyFame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, surfet, and lust, till wantonness and prideRaise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. The conquerd also, and enslaved by Warrshall with thir freedom lost all vertu looseAnd feare of God, from whom thir pietie feignedIn sharp contest of Battel found no aideAgainst invaders; therefore coold in zealeThenceforth shall practice how to live secure,Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lordsshall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear More then anough, that temperance may be tried:so all shall turn degenerate, all depraved,Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;One Man except, the onely son of lightIn a dark Age, against example good,Against allurement, custom, and a WorldOffended; fearless of reproach and scorn,Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayesshall them admonish, and before them setThe paths of righteousness, how much more safe, And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to comeOn thir impenitence; and shall returneOf them derided, but of God observdThe one just Man alive; by his commandshall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,To save himself and houshold from amidstA World devote to universal rack. No sooner hee with them of Man and Beastselect for life shall in the Ark be lodged,And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts Of heaven set open on the Earth shall powreRaine day and night, all fountaines of the DeepBroke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurpBeyond all bounds, till inundation riseAbove the highest Hills: then shall this MountOf Paradise by might of Waves be moovdOut of his place, pushd by the horned floud,With all his verdure spoiled, and Trees adriftDown the great River to the op'ning Gulf,And there take root an Iland salt and bare, The haunt of seales and Orcs, and sea-mews clang. To teach thee that God attributes to placeNo sanctitie, if none be thither broughtBy Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. And now what further shall ensue, behold. He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drieWrinkled the face of Deluge, as decaied;And the cleer sun on his wide watrie Glass Gazed hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrinkFrom standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stoleWith soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt•…is is sluces, as the heaven his windows shut. The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on groundFast on the top of som high mountain fixt. And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;With clamor thence the rapid Currents driveTowards the retreating sea thir furious tyde. Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,And after him, the surer messenger,A Dove sent forth once and agen to spieGreen Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;The second time returning, in his BillAn Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:Anon drie ground appeers, and from his ArkeThe ancient sire descends with all his Train;Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,Grateful to heaven, over his head beholds A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a BowConspicuous with three listed colours gay,Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new. Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sadGreatly rejoyced, and thus his joy broke forth. O thou that future things canst representAs present, heavenly instructer, I reviveAt this last sight, assured that Man shall liveWith all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. Farr less I now lament for one whole World Of wicked sons destroyd, then I rejoyceFor one Man found so perfet and so just,That God voutsafes to raise another WorldFrom him, and all his anger to forget. But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,Distended as the Brow of God appeased,Or serve they as a flourie verge to bindeThe fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth?To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st;so willingly doth God remit his Ire, Though late repenting him of Man depraved,Grieved at his heart, when looking down he sawThe whole Earth •…illed with violence, and all fleshCorrupting each thirway; yet those remooved,such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,That he relents, not to blot out mankind,And makes a Covenant never to destroyThe Earth again by flood, nor let the seasurpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the WorldWith Man therein or Beast; but when he brings Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein setHis triple-coloured Bow, whereon to lookAnd call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night,seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frostshall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,Both heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell. Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end;And Man as from a second stock proceed. Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceaveThy mortal sight to faile; objects divine Must needs impaire and wearie human sense:Henceforth what is to com I will relate,Thou therefore give due audience, and attend. This second sours of Men, while yet but few;And while the dread of judgement past remainsFresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,With some regard to what is just and rightshall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace,Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock, Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,With large Winé-offerings poured, and sacred Feastshal spend thir dayes in joy unblamed, and dwellLong time in peace by Families and TribesUnder paternal rule; till one shall riseOf proud ambitious heart, who not contentWith fair equalitie, fraternal state,Will arrogate Dominion undeservedOver his brethren, and quite dispossessConcord and law of Nature from the Earth; Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)With Warr and hostile snare such as refusesubjection to his Empire tyrannous:A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styledBefore the Lord, as in despite of heaven,Or from heaven claming second sovrantie;And from Rebellion shall derive his name,Though of Rebellion others he accuse. Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joynsWith him or under him to tyrannize, Marching from Eden towards the West, shall findeThe Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurgeBoiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to buildA Citie & Towre, whose top may reach to heaven;And get themselves a name, least far disperstIn foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,Regardless whether good or evil fame. But God who oft descends to visit menUnseen, and through thir habitations walks To mark thir doings, them beholding soon,Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the TowerObstruct heaven Towrs, and in derision setsUpon thir Tongues a various spirit to raseQuite out thir Native Language, and insteadTo sow a jangling noise of words unknown:Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loudAmong the Builders; each to other callsNot understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,As mockt they storm; great laughter was in heaven And looking down, to see the hubbub strangeAnd hear the din; thus was the building leftRidiculous, and the work Confusion named. Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeased. O execrable son so to aspireAbove his Brethren, to himself assumingAuthoritie usurpt, from God not giv'n:He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, FowlDominion absolute; that right we holdBy his donation; but Man over men He made not Lord; such title to himselfReserving, human left from human free. But this Usurper his encroachment proudstayes not on Man; to God his Tower intendssiege and defiance: Wretched man! what foodWill he convey up thither to sustainHimself and his rash Armie, where thin AireAbove the Clouds will pine his entrails gross,And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread?To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorr'st That son, who on the quiet state of mensuch trouble brought, affecting to subdueRational Libertie; yet know withall,since thy original lapse, true LibertieIs lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwellsTwinned, and from her hath no dividual being:Reason in man obscured, or not obeyd,Immediately inordinate desiresAnd upstart Passions ca•…ch the GovernmentFrom Reason, and to fervitude reduce Man till then free. Therefore since hee permitsWithin himself unworthie Powers to reignOver free Reason, God in Judgement justsubjects him from without to violent Lords;Who oft as undeservedly enthrallHis outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse. Yet somtimes Nations will decline so lowFrom vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,But Justice, and some fatal curse annext Deprives them of thir outward libertie,Thir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent sonOf him who built the Ark, who for the shameDon to his Father, heard this heavie curse,servant of servants, on his vitious Race. Thus will this latter, as the former World,still tend from bad to worse, till God at lastWearied with their iniquities, withdrawHis presence from among them, and avertHis holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth To leave them to thir own polluted wayes;And one peculiar Nation to selectFrom all the rest, of whom to be invoked,A Nation from one faithful man to spring:Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,While yet the Patriark lived, who scaped the Flood,As to forsake the living God, and fallTo worship thir own work in Wood and stone For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafesTo call by Vision from his Fathers house,His kind•…ed and false Gods, into a LandWhich he will shew him, and from him will raiseA mightie Nation, and upon him showreHis benediction so, that in his seedAll Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:I see him, but thou canst not, with what FaithHe leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native soile Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the FordTo Haran, after him a cumbrous TrainOf Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealthWith God, who called him, in a land unknown. Canaan he now attains, I see his TentsPitcht about sechem, and the neighbouring PlaineOf Moreh; there by promise he receavesGift to his Progenie of all that Land;From Hamath Northward to the Desert south (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnamed)From Hermon East to the great Western sea,Mount Hermon, yonder sea, each place beholdIn prospect, as I point them; on the shoareMount Carmel; here the double-founted streamJordan, true limit Eastward; but his sonsshall dwell to senir, that long ridge of Hills. This ponder, that all Nations of the Earthshall in his seed be blessed; by that seedIs meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise The serpents head; whereof to thee anonPlainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest,Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,A son, and of his son a Grand-childe leaves,Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;The Grandchilde with twelve sons increast, departsFrom Canaan, to a Land hereafter calledEgypt, divided by the River Nile;
        see where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthesInto the sea: to sojourn in that Land He comes invited by a yonger sonIn time of dearth, a son whose worthy deedsRaise him to be the second in that RealmeOf Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his RaceGrowing into a Nation, and now grownsuspected to a sequent King, who seeksTo stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guestsToo numerous; whence of guests he makes them slavesInhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:Till by two brethren (those two brethren call Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claimeHis people from enthralment, they returnWith glory and spoile back to thir promised Land. But first the lawless Tyrant, who deniesTo know thir God, or message to regard,Must be compelld by signes and Judgements dire;To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace •…illWith loathed intru•…on, and fill all the land;His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die, Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,Haile mixt with fire must rend th' Egyptian skieAnd wheel on th' Earth, devouring where it rouls;What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming downMust eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes; Last with one midnight stroke all the first-bornOf Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten woundsThis River-dragon tamed at length submitsTo let his sojourners depart, and oftHumbles his stubborn heart, but still as IceMore hard'nd after thaw, till in his ragePursuing whom he late dismissd, the seaswallows him with his Host, but them lets passAs on drie land between two christal walls,Awed by the rod of Moses so to standDivided, till his rescued gain thir shoar: such wondrous power God to his saint will lend,Though present in his Angel, who shall goeBefore them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,By day a Cloud, by night a pillar of Fire,To guide them in thir journey, and removeBehinde them, while th' obdurat King pursues:All night he will pursue, but his approachDarkness defends between till morning Watch;Then through the Firey Pillar and the CloudGod looking forth will trouble all his Host And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by commandMoses once more his potent Rod extendsOver the sea; the sea his Rod obeys;On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race electsafe towards Canaan from the shoar advanceThrough the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,Least entring on the Canaanite allarmdWarr terrifie them inexpert, and feareReturn them back to Egypt, choosing rather Inglorious life with servitude; for lifeTo noble and ignoble is more sweetUntraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on. This also shall they gain by thir delayIn the wide Wilderness, there they shall foundThir government, and thir great senate chooseThrough the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:God from the Mount of sinai, whose gray topshall tremble, he descending, will himselfIn Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaineTo civil Justice, part religious RitesOf sacrifice, informing them, by typesAnd shadowes, of that destind seed to bruiseThe serpent, by what meanes he shall achieveMankinds deliverance. But the voice of GodTo mortal eare is dreadful; they beseechThat Moses might report to them his will,And terror cease; he grants them thir desire,Instructed that to God is no access Without Mediator, whose high Office nowMoses in figure beares, to introduceOne greater, of whose day he shall foretell,And all the Prophets in thir Age the timesOf great Messiah shall sing. Thus Laws and RitesEstablisht, such delight hath God in MenObedient to his will, that he voutsafesAmong them to set up his Tabernacle,The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:By his prescript a sanctuary is framed Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, thereinAn Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,The Records of his Cov'nant, over theseA Mercie-seat of Gold between the wingsOf two bright Cherubim, before him burnseaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representingThe heavenly fires; over the Tent a Cloudshall rest by Day, a 〈◊〉 gleame by Night,save when they journie, and at length they come,Conducted by his Angel to the Land Promisd to Abraham and his seed: the restWere long to tell, how many Battels fought,How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,Or how the sun shall in mid heaven stand stillA day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,Mans voice commanding, sun in Gibeon stand,And thou Moon in the vale of Aialon,
        Till Israel overcome; so call the thirdFrom Abraham, son of Isaac, and from himHis whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win. Here Adam interposed. O sent from heaven,Enlightner of my darkness, gracious thingsThou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerneJust Abraham and his seed: now first I findeMine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eased,Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becomOf mee and all Mankind; but now I seeHis day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,Favour unmerited by me, who soughtForbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means. This yet I apprehend not, why to thoseAmong whom God will deigne to dwell on Earthso many and so various Laws are giv'n;so many Laws argue so many sinsAmong them; how can God with such refide?To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sinWill reign among them, as of thee begot;And therefore was Law given them to evinceThir natural pravitie, by stirring upsin against Law to fight; that when they see Law can discover sin, but not remove,save by those shadowie expiations weak,The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may concludesome bloud more precious must be paid for Man,Just for unjust, that in such righteousnessTo them by Faith imputed, they may findeJustification towards God, and peaceOf Conscience, which the Law by CeremoniesCannot appease, nor Man the moral partPerform, and not performing cannot live. so Law appears imperfet, and but giv'nWith purpose to resign them in full timeUp to a better Cov'nant, disciplinedFrom shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to spirit,From imposition of strict Laws, to freeAcceptance of large Grace, from servil fearTo filial▪ works of Law to works of Faith. And therefore shall not Moses, though of GodHighly beloved, being but the MinisterOf Law, his people into Canaan lead; But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call,His Name and Office bearing, who shall quellThe adversarie serpent, and bring backThrough the worlds wilderness long wanderd mansafe to eternal Paradise of rest. Meanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plac'tLong time shall dwell and prosper, but when sinsNational interrupt thir public peace,Provoking God to raise them enemies:From whom as oft he saves them penitent By Judges first, then under Kings; of whomThe second, both for pietie renowndAnd puissant deeds, a promise shall receiveIrrevocable, that his Regal ThroneFor ever shall endure; the like shall singAll Prophecie, That of the Royal stockOf David (so I name this King) shall riseA son, the Womans seed to thee foretold,Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trustAll Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings The last, for of his Reign shall be no end. But first a long succession must ensue,And his next son for Wealth and Wisdom famed,The clouded Ark of God till then in TentsWandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine. such follow him, as shall be registerdPart good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,Whose foul Idolatries, and other faultsHeapt to the popular summe, will so incenseGod, as to leave them, and expose thir Land, Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy ArkWith all his sacred things, a scorn and preyTo that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw'stLeft in confusion, Babylon thence called. There in captivitie he lets them dwellThe space of seventie years, then brings them back,Remembring mercie, and his Cov'nant swornTo David, stablisht as the dayes of heaven. Returnd from Babylon by leave of KingsThir Lords, whom God disposed, the house of God They first re-edifie, and for a whileIn mean estate live moderate, till grownIn wealth and multitude, factious they grow;But first among the Priests dissension springs,Men who attend the Altar, and should mostEndeavour Peace: thir strife pollution bringsUpon the Temple it self: at last they seiseThe scepter, and regard not Davids sons,Then loose it to a stranger, that the trueAnointed King Messiah might be born Barred of his right; yet at his Birth a starrUnseen before in heaven proclaims him com,And guides the Eastern sages, who enquireHis place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;His place of birth a solemn Angel tellsTo simple shepherds, keeping watch by night;They gladly thither haste, and by a QuireOf squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung. A Virgin is his Mother, but his sireThe Power of the most High; he shall ascend The Throne hereditarie, and bound his ReignWith earths wide bounds, his glory with the heavens. He ceased, discerning Adam with such joysurcharged, as had like grief bin dewed in tears,Without the vent of words, which these he breathd. O Prophet of glad tidings, finisherOf utmost hope! now clear I understandWhat oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,Why our great expectation should be calledThe seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile, High in the love of heaven, yet from my LoynesThou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the sonOf God most High; so God with man unites. Needs must the serpent now his capital bruiseExpect with mortal paine: say where and whenThir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel. To whom thus Michael. Dream not of thir fight,As of a Duel, or the local woundsOf head or heel: not therefore joynes the sonManhood to God-head, with more strength to foil Thy enemie; nor so is overcomesatan, whose fall from heaven, a deadlier bruise,Disabled not to give thee thy deaths wound:Which hee, who comes thy saviour, shall recure,Not by destroying satan, but his worksIn thee and in thy seed: nor can this be,But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,Obedience to the Law of God, imposedOn penaltie of death, and suffering death,The penaltie to thy transgression due, And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:so onely can high Justice rest appaid. The Law of God exact he shall fulfillBoth by obedience and by love, though loveAlone fulfill the Law; thy punishmentHe shall endure by coming in the FleshTo a reproachful life and cursed death,Proclaming Life to all who shall believeIn his redemption, and that his obedienceImputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits To save them, not thir own, though legal works. For this he shall live hated, be blasphemed,seised on by force, judged, and to death condemndA shameful and accurst, naild to the CrossBy his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,The Law that is against thee, and the sinsOf all mankinde, with him there crucified,Never to hurt them more who rightly trustIn this his satisfaction; so he dies, But soon revives, Death over him no powershall long usurp; ere the third dawning lightReturne, the starres of Morn shall see him riseOut of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,His death for Man, as many as offerd LifeNeglect not, and the benefit imbraceBy Faith not void of workes: this God-like actAnnuls thy doom▪ the death thou shouldst have died,In sin for ever lost from life; this act shall bruise the head of satan, crush his strengthDefeating sin and Death, his two maine armes,And fix farr deeper in his head thir stingsThen temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,A gentle wafting to immortal Life. Nor after resurrection shall he stayLonger on Earth then certaine times to appeerTo his Disciples, Men who in his Lifestill followed him; to them shall leave in charge To teach all nations what of him they learnedAnd his salvation, them who shall beleeveBaptizing in the profluent streame, the signeOf washing them from guilt of sin to LifePure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,For death, like that which the redeemer died. All Nations they shall teach; for from that dayNot onely to the sons of Abrahams Loinessalvation shall be Preacht, but to the sonsOf Abrahams Faith wherever through the world; so in his seed all Nations shall be blest. Then to the heaven of heavens he shall ascendWith victory, triumphing through the aireOver his foes and thine; there shall surpriseThe serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in ChainesThrough all his realme, & there confounded leave;Then enter into glory, and resumeHis seat at Gods right hand, exalted highAbove all names in heaven; and thence shall come,When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe, With glory and power to judge both quick & dead,To judge th' unfaithful dead, but to rewardHis faithful, and receave them into bliss,Whether in heaven or Earth, for then the Earthshall all be Paradise, far happier placeThen this of Eden, and far happier daies. so spake th' Archangel Michael, then paused,As at the Worlds great period; and our sireReplete with joy and wonder thus replied. O goodness infinite, goodness immense! That all this good of evil shall produce,And evil turn to good; more wonderfulThen that which by creation first brought forthLight out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,Whether I should repent me now of sinBy mee done and occasiond, or rejoyceMuch more, that much more good thereof shall spring,To God more glory, more good will to MenFrom God, and over wrauth grace shall abound. But say, if our deliverer up to heaven Must reascend, what will betide the fewHis faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd,The enemies of truth; who then shall guideHis people, who defend? will they not dealeWors with his followers then with him they dealt?Be sure they will, said th' Angel; but from heavenHee to his own a Comforter will send,The promise of the Father, who shall dwellHis spirit within them, and the Law of FaithWorking through love, upon thir hearts shall write, To guide them in all truth, and also armeWith spiritual Armour, able to resistsatans assaults, and quench his fierie darts,What Man can do against them, not affraid,Though to the death, against such crueltiesWith inward consolations recompenc't,And oft supported so as shall amazeThir proudest persecuters: for the spiritPowrd first on his Apostles, whom he sendsTo evangelize the Nations, then on all Baptized, shall them with wondrous gifts endueTo speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,As did thir Lord before them. Thus they winGreat numbers of each Nation to receaveWith joy the tidings brought from heaven: at lengthThir Ministry performed, and race well run,Thir doctrine and thir story written left,They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne,Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,Who all the sacred mysteries of heaven To thir own vile advantages shall turneOf lucre and ambition, and the truthWith superstitions and traditions taint,Left onely in those written Records pure,Though not but by the spirit understood. Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,Places and titles, and with these to joinesecular power, though feigning still to actBy spiritual, to themselves appropriatingThe spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n To all Beleevers; and from that pretense,spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall forceOn every conscience; Laws which none shall findeLeft them inrould, or what the spirit withinshall on the heart engrave. What will they thenBut force the spirit of Grace it self, and bindeHis consort Libertie; what, but unbuildHis living Temples, built by Faith to stand,Thir own Faith not anothers: for on EarthWho against Faith and Conscience can be heard Infallible? yet many will presume:Whence heavie persecution shall ariseOn all who in the worship persevereOf spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,Will deem in outward Rites and specious formesReligion satisfied; Truth shall retireBestuck with slandrous darts, and works of FaithRarely be found: so shall the World goe on,To good malignant, to bad men benigne,Under her own waight groaning, till the day Appeer of respiration to the just,And vengeance to the wicked, at returnOf him so lately promissed to thy aid,The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,Now amplier known thy saviour and thy Lord,Last in the Clouds from heaven to be revealdIn glory of the Father, to dissolvesatan with his perverted World, then raiseFrom the conflagrant mass, purged and refined,New heavens, new Earth, Ages of endless date Founded in righteousness and peace and love,To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss. He ended; and thus Adam last replied. How soon hath thy prediction, seer blest,Measured this transient World, the Race of time,Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach. Greatly instructed I shall hence depart,Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fillOf knowledge, what this vessel can containe; Beyond which was my folly to aspire. Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best,And love with feare the onely God, to walkAs in his presence, ever to observe,His providence, and on him sole depend,Merciful over all his works, with goodstill overcoming evil, and by smallAccomplishing great things, by things deemd weaksubverting worldly strong, and worldly wiseBy simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake Is fortitude to highest victorie,And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;Taught this by his example whom I nowAcknowledge my Redeemer ever blest. To whom thus also th' Angel last replied:This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summeOf wisdom; hope no higher, though all the starrsThou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers,All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,Or works of God in heaven, Air, Earth, or sea, And all the riches of this World enjoydst,And all the rule, one Empire; onely addDeeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,By name to come called Charitie, the soulOf all the rest: then wilt thou not be loathTo leave this Paradise, but shalt possessA Paradise within thee, happier farr. Let us descend now therefore from this topOf speculation; for the hour precise Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expectThir motion, at whose Front a flaming sword,In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;
        Her also I with gentle Dreams have calmedPortending good, and all her spirits composedTo meek submission: thou at season fitLet her with thee partake what thou hast heard,Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know, The great deliverance by her seed to come(For by the Womans seed) on all Mankind. That ye may live, which will be many dayes,Both in one Faith unanimous though sad,With cause for evils past, yet much more cheeredWith meditation on the happie end. He ended, and they both descend the Hill;Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve
        Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't;And thus with words not sad she him receaved. Whence thou returnst, & whither wentst, I know;For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,Which he hath sent propitious, some great goodPresaging, since with sorrow and hearts distressVVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;In mee is no delay; with thee to goe,Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,Is to go hence unwilling; thou to meeArt all things under heaven, all places thou,VVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence. This further consolation yet secureI carry hence; though all by mee is lost,such favour I unworthie am voutsaft,By mee the Promised seed shall all restore. so spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heardVVell pleased, but answered not; for now too nighTh' Archangel stood, and from the other HillTo thir fixt station, all in bright arrayThe Cherubim descended; on the groundGliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist Ris'n from a River o're the marish glides,And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heelHomeward returning. High in Front advanc't,The brandisht sword of God before them blazedFierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,And vapour as the Libyan Air adust,Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereatIn either hand the hastning Angel caughtOur lingring Parents, and to th' Eastern GateLed them direct, and down the Cliff as fast To the subjected Plaine; then disappeered. They looking back, all th' Eastern side beheldOf Paradise, so late thir happie seat,Waved over by that flaming Brand, the •…ateWith dreadful Faces thronged and fierie Armes:som natural tears they droped, but wiped them soon;The World was all before them, where to chooseThir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow,Through Eden took thir solitarie way. THE END. "
